<p>February 8, 1864, on the day of introducing his Amendment of the
Constitution, declaring that “all persons are equal before the law,”
Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to bring
in a bill to secure equality before the law in the courts of the United
States, which was read the first and second times by unanimous consent,
and, on his motion, referred to the Committee on Slavery and
Freedmen. This was in harmony with other efforts on an earlier day.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
February 29th, he reported the bill to the Senate without amendment,
accompanied by the following report, of which three thousand extra
copies were ordered to be printed for the use of the Senate. The success
of this measure appears at a later date.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Before making a change in our laws, it is important
to consider the nature and extent of what is
proposed; especially is this the case, if the change will
be far-reaching in influence. Therefore the Committee
have thought best, in proposing to prohibit all exclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of colored testimony in the courts of the United States,
to exhibit with some particularity the considerations
bearing on the subject.</p>


<h3>EXCLUSION OF COLORED TESTIMONY RECOGNIZED BY
CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>Congress has never, in formal words, declared that
witnesses in the courts of the United States shall be
incompetent to testify on account of color. The abuse
has arisen indirectly. But it is none the less fastened
upon the national jurisprudence. By Act of July 16,
1862, it was provided “that the laws of the State in
which the court shall be held shall be the rules of decision
as to the competency of witnesses in the courts of
the United States, in trials at Common Law, in Equity,
and Admiralty.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And this rule, thus authoritatively
declared, had been practically recognized by the courts
of the United States from the beginning of the Government.
It appears from the Judiciary Act of 1789, under
which the national courts were organized, that jurors
in these courts “shall have the same qualifications as
are requisite for jurors by the laws of the State of which
they are citizens”; and still further, “that the laws of
the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties,
or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require
or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision
in trials at Common Law in the courts of the United
States, in cases where they apply.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Under these injunctions
it was very easy, if not natural, for the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
courts to adopt the law of evidence in the States where
they were respectively held; and thus the incapacity of
colored testimony in those States where it prevailed became
a rule of evidence in the national tribunals.</p>

<p>It is plain that such a system made the administration
of justice differ in different States. The same statute
might be successfully administered in a State where
there was no exclusion of colored testimony, and miserably
fail in another State where such exclusion prevailed;
and the same judge might be called in one
court to admit the testimony, and in another court to
reject it. But the least objection to this system is its
want of uniformity. In lending the sanction of the
United States, even indirectly, to an exclusion founded
on color, all the people have been made parties to injustice.</p>

<p>To appreciate the true character of this proscription,
we must repair to the Slave States, where it is declared,
and consider it in the very language, legislative and
judicial, by which it is maintained, not neglecting the
eccentricities of judicial opinion by which it has been
illustrated. From the statement of the rule its consequences
will become apparent. It may be proper afterwards
to glance at the associate examples of history,
and also to endeavor to comprehend the reasons on
which the proscription has been vindicated.</p>


<h3>EXCLUSION OF COLORED TESTIMONY IN THE SLAVE
STATES.</h3>

<p>The Committee begin with the statutes of the States
where this proscription prevails. Each State will be
considered by itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>(1.) In Delaware the rule assumes its mildest form,
yet even there it is indefensible. It has been expressed
by Chief Justice Bayard, who, in an opinion of the court,
said: “On the introduction of Negro Slavery into this
country, it became a settled rule of law that slaves
should not be suffered to give evidence in any matter,
civil or criminal, affecting the rights of a white man.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
In this spirit the Revised Code of Delaware has provided
that “to give evidence against any white person”
is one of the “rights of a freeman.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But the rule is
thus applied: “In criminal prosecutions, a free negro, or
free mulatto, if otherwise competent, may testify, if it
shall appear to the court that no competent white witness
was present at the time the fact charged is alleged
to have been committed, or that a white witness, being
so present, has since died, or is absent from the State,
and cannot be produced: <i>Provided</i>, that no free negro
or free mulatto shall be admitted as a witness to charge
a white man with being the father of a bastard child.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
With this exception, the free negro or mulatto is disqualified
as a witness against a white person.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But colored
testimony is admissible in a case between colored
persons, or against a colored person where the other
party is white.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The subtilties in the application of this rule appear
in a decided case, where one of three accomplices was
indicted for kidnapping a colored boy. The latter was
opposed as a witness, on the ground that a competent
white witness, an accomplice who had not been indicted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
might be produced. But the court, considering that
the statute was originally enacted to remedy injustice
to free persons of color, construed it liberally, and admitted
the testimony of the colored boy, on the ground
that the commission of an offence by two or more persons
ought not to render a witness incompetent, who
would be competent, if the offence had been committed
by only one person. It was further said, that the statute,
when it speaks of a competent white witness, means
not merely his competency in the common sense of the
term, but the sufficiency of his evidence under ordinary
circumstances to produce conviction,&mdash;although a jury
was directed to acquit the prisoner, unless part of the
accomplice’s testimony was confirmed by unimpeachable
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In another case, where two white witnesses,
not accomplices, were present at an assault, the court
at first excluded the testimony of the colored person;
but when it afterwards appeared that one of them was
drunk and the other did not see the whole transaction,
although both knew that a blow was struck, the testimony
of the colored person was admitted.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Still further, it has been declared in Delaware, that,
on indictment of a white man for kidnapping a free
colored person, the latter is not competent to prove
his freedom.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> So, also, in an action against a stage-coach
proprietor for aiding in the escape of a slave, the
admission of the latter that he is slave of the plaintiff
cannot be received.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But a free colored person may
make oath to his book of original entries, and thus make
it evidence even against a white person, on the declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
ground that “it would be idle [for the law] to recognize
in persons of color the right to hold property, and to
obtain redress in law and equity for injuries to person
or property, if the means of this redress be denied
them.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Prior to the statute originally passed in 1799, where
a white person committed an assault on a colored woman,
and there was no third person present, the latter
was held as a witness;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but where several white persons
were present, the colored person was held incompetent.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>(2.) In Maryland, the Act of 1717, Ch. 13, § 2, provides
that “no negro or mulatto slave, free negro, or
mulatto born of a white woman during his time of servitude
by law, or any Indian slave, or free Indian natives
of this or the neighboring provinces, be admitted
and received as good and valid evidence in law, in any
matter or thing whatsoever depending before any court
of record, or before any magistrate within this province,
wherein any Christian white person is concerned.” Yet,
nevertheless, according to this same Act, § 3, where other
sufficient evidence is wanting against any negro, in such
case the testimony of any negro may be heard and received
in evidence, according to the discretion of the
several courts of record or magistrate before whom such
matter or thing against such negro shall depend, provided
such testimony do not extend to depriving them
of life or member.</p>

<p>The same system is pursued in the later Act of 1796,
Ch. 67, § 5, which provides that manumitted slaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
shall not be allowed “to give evidence against any white
person,” nor be received “as competent evidence to
manumit any slave petitioning for freedom.” But by
Act of 1808, Ch. 81, § 1, it is provided, that, in all criminal
prosecutions against any negro or mulatto, slave
or free, the testimony of any negro or mulatto, slave
or free, “may be received in evidence for or against
them, any law now existing to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>The original Act of 1717 does not in terms extend to
free mulattoes, and the Act of 1796 does not extend to
the issue of manumitted slaves. But where “a free-born
white Christian man” was convicted of felony on
the testimony of a mulatto born of a manumitted negro,
there was among the judges in the Court of Appeals such
diversity of opinion on the legality of the testimony that
no decision was ever given.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In another case it was decided,
that, where both parties are “free white Christian
persons,” a free colored person is incompetent,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> although
a mulatto descended in the female line from a white
woman is competent.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>(3.) In Virginia, the Code declares positively that
“a negro or Indian shall be a competent witness in a
case of the Commonwealth for or against a negro or
Indian, or in a civil case to which only negroes or Indians
are parties, <em>but not in any other case</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The decisions
of the courts illustrate this proscription. Thus, it
has been adjudged that a free colored person cannot testify
for a white person, even against a colored person.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
In another case a question was incidentally raised on
the competency of a colored convict as a witness against
another convict, with regard to an offence committed
in the penitentiary, and it was suggested that convicts
generally might be witnesses against each other.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This
question, however, was subsequently disposed of by a
provision declaring, that, on the prosecution of a convict,
“all other convicts in the penitentiary shall be
competent witnesses for or against the accused, <em>except
that negroes shall not be allowed as witnesses against
a white person</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They may, however, testify in his
favor.</p>

<p>(4.) In Kentucky, the Revised Statutes provide that
“a slave, negro, or Indian shall be a competent witness
in a case of the Commonwealth for or against a slave,
negro, or Indian, or in a civil case to which only negroes
or Indians are parties, <em>but in no other case</em>. This shall
not be construed to exclude an Indian in other cases,
who speaks the English language and understands the
nature and obligation of an oath.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Under this provision,
as under that of Virginia, it has been decided that
a free colored person cannot be a witness for a white
person against a colored person.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>(5.) In North Carolina, the Revised Statutes provide
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> “all negroes, Indians, mulattoes, and all persons of
mixed blood descended from negro and Indian ancestors
to the fourth generation inclusive, (though one ancestor
of each generation may have been a white person,)
whether bond or free, shall be deemed and taken to be
<em>incapable in law to be witnesses in any case whatsoever</em>,
except against each other.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Under this statute they
cannot testify for each other in a criminal case. But
the decisions furnish curious illustrations. Thus, when
a colored person was convicted on colored testimony as a
principal felon, it was subsequently held, on trial of the
white accessory, that the record of the conviction was
only <i>primâ facie</i> evidence of guilt.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In another case it
was held that a free colored woman could not make
affidavit charging a white man as father of her illegitimate
child,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> although the contrary has been decided in
Kentucky, on the assumption that the act is merely
preliminary to the real controversy.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>(6.) In Tennessee, the Act of 1794, Ch. 1, § 32, provides
that “all negroes, Indians, mulattoes, and all persons
of mixed blood descended from negro and Indian
ancestors to the third generation inclusive, (though one
ancestor of each generation may have been a white person,)
whether bond or free, shall be taken and deemed
to be incapable in law to be witnesses in any case whatever,
<em>except against each other</em>: <i>Provided</i>, That no person
of mixed blood in any degree whatsoever, who has
been liberated within twelve months previously, shall
be admitted as a witness against a white person.” Under
this Act, evidently borrowed from the earlier statute
of North Carolina, it was decided that a colored person
could not be a witness <em>for</em> another colored person. The
judge who pronounced the opinion of the court seems
to confess the harshness of the rule, when he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> “The
cases under this Act in which these disqualified persons
can be witnesses for each other are when, plaintiff and
defendant both being men of color, the witnesses may
at the same time be said to be reciprocally witnesses
against each of the parties. Perhaps the practice in
Tennessee may have been heretofore much more liberal
than the statute. With that we have nothing to
do. As the law speaks, so it is our duty to speak.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
To remedy this gross injustice, the Act of 1839, Ch. 7,
§ 1, was passed, providing that such parties, “whether
bond or free, shall be taken and deemed to be good witnesses
for each other in all cases, where, by the provisions
of said Act [viz. Act of 1794], they are made competent
witnesses against each other in criminal prosecutions.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>(7.) In South Carolina there appears to have been
no statute expressly excluding the testimony of a slave
against a white person, although the early Act of 1740,
§ 39, necessarily implies this exclusion.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But the rule
was autochthonous. It sprang from the soil without
statute. Judge O’Neall, in an Essay on the Slave Laws,
declares that “a slave cannot testify, except as against
another slave, free negro, mulatto, or mestizo, and that
without oath.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But the exclusion did not bear merely
upon slaves. The judge announces that “free negroes,
mulattoes, and mestizoes cannot be witnesses or
jurors in the superior courts; … they cannot even
be witnesses in inferior courts, with the single exception
of a magistrate’s and freeholder’s court, trying slaves
or free negroes, mulattoes or mestizoes, for criminal offences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and then without oath.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It appears that the
Act of 1740, §§ 13, 14, on which this custom was
founded, applies only to free Indians and slaves;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> so
that, strictly, free negroes, mulattoes, and mestizoes are
not despoiled of their right at Common Law to be
heard under oath, but the uniform practice under the
Act, according to the judge, has been otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> On
another occasion, another judge of South Carolina says:
“There is no instance in which a negro has been permitted
to give evidence, except in cases of absolute and
indispensable necessity; nor, indeed, has this court ever
recognized the propriety of admitting them in any case
where the rights of white persons were concerned.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In
still another case it was decided that a free person of
color is not competent in any case in a court of record,
although both parties are of the same class with
himself.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The rule thus rigorously declared has given rise to
some strange illustrations. Thus, for instance, in a suit
to recover certain slaves as part of a gang named, evidence
was admitted that other negroes of the defendant
were accustomed to speak of those in question as
belonging to the gang.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In another case, where the
book of a tradesman was made up from the entries of
a negro workman on a slate, and notice was affixed
to the door of the shop that all credits there would
be charged according to the negro’s entries, the Court
doubted whether the book could be evidence at all,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
if at all, only as to the amount of work done, and
then only against a person otherwise proved to be a
customer.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>(8.) In Georgia, as in South Carolina, there is no
statute expressly excluding the testimony of a slave
where white persons are parties. But they are excluded.
The Act of 1770, declaring slaves to be chattels
personal to all intents and purposes whatsoever, provides
further, “that the evidence of any free Indians,
mulattoes, mestizoes, or negroes, or slaves, shall be allowed
and admitted in all cases whatsoever for or against
another slave accused of any crime or offence whatsoever,
the weight of which evidence, being seriously considered
and compared with all other circumstances attending
the case, shall be left to the justices and jury.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
But where white persons are parties, the rule of exclusion
seems implied. And the same exclusion seems
also implied in the later Act of December 19, 1816, § 5,
where the rule, that “any witness shall be sworn who
believes in God and a future state of rewards and punishments,”
is restricted to “the trial of a slave or free
person of color.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>(9.) In Alabama the exclusion stands on positive
statute. The Code provides that “negroes, mulattoes,
Indians, and all persons of mixed blood descended from
negro or Indian ancestors to the third generation inclusive,
though one ancestor of each generation may have
been a white person, whether bond or free, must not be
witnesses in any cause, civil or criminal, except for or
against each other.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>(10.) In Mississippi, the Act of June 28, 1822, is
nearly the same in language with the Code of Alabama
on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But by Act of January 19, 1830, free
Indians are placed on the same footing as white persons,
and consequently can testify.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>(11.) In Florida the law is brief and explicit. The
Act of November 21, 1828, § 16, provides that “any
negro or mulatto, bond or free, shall be a good witness
in the pleas of the State for or against negroes or mulattoes,
bond or free, or in civil cases where free negroes
or mulattoes shall alone be parties, and in no other cases
whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>(12.) In Missouri, the Revised Statutes provide that
“no negro or mulatto, bond or free, shall be a competent
witness, except in pleas of the State against a negro
or mulatto, bond or free, or in civil cases in which negroes
or mulattoes alone are parties.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But it has been
decided, that, if a free negro is party to the record, even
though he vouches in a white person to defend his title,
colored testimony is admissible.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>(13.) In Arkansas, the Revised Statutes provide that
“no negro or mulatto, bond or free, shall be a competent
witness in any case, except in cases in which all the
parties are negroes or mulattoes, or in which the State
is plaintiff and a negro or mulatto, or negroes or mulattoes,
are defendants.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>(14.) In Louisiana, the Revised Statutes provide
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> “no slave shall be admitted as a witness, either
in civil or criminal matters, for or against a white person”;
and also, “no slave shall be admitted as a witness,
either in civil or criminal matters, for or against a
free person of color, except in case such free individual
be charged with having raised, or attempted to raise, an
insurrection among the slaves of this State, or adhering
to them by giving them aid or comfort in any manner
whatsoever.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The Civil Code declares “absolutely incapable of
being witnesses to testaments” “women of what age
soever,” and “slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> But the Civil Code has provided
expressly that “the circumstance of the witness
being a free colored person is not a sufficient cause to
consider the witness as incompetent, but may, according
to circumstances, diminish the extent of his credibility”;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
so that a free colored person in Louisiana may
be a witness for or against a white person, subject to
inquiry as to the value of his testimony.</p>

<p>(15.) In Texas, the Act of May 13, 1846, provides
that “all negroes and Indians, and all persons of mixed
blood descended from negro ancestry to the third generation
inclusive, though one ancestor of each generation
may have been a white person, shall be incapable of being
a witness in any case whatever, except for or against
each other.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>


<h3>SUMMARY STATEMENT OF THE RULE.</h3>

<p>From this review of the provisions in the different
States it appears, that, with slight differences, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
nevertheless a prevailing resemblance, such as becomes
the sisterhood of Slavery.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">“Facies non omnibus una,</div>
<div class="verse">Nec diversa tamen; qualem decet esse sororum.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If the recital seems weary, it has not been superfluous,
for it has disclosed the disgusting terms of that proscription.
It is difficult to read the provisions in a single
State without impatience; but the recurrence of this
injustice, expressed with such particularity in no less
than fifteen States,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> makes impatience swell into indignation,
especially when it is considered that in every
State this injustice is adopted and enforced by the
courts of the United States.</p>

<p>Slaves cannot testify in any of the States for or
against a white person in any case, either civil or criminal,&mdash;unless,
perhaps, in Maryland they may be allowed
to testify against a white person who is not a
Christian.</p>

<p>Free persons of color are also, like slaves, incompetent
to testify for or against white persons, except in Delaware
and Louisiana, where, under circumstances already
stated, they may testify, even though a white person is
a party.</p>

<p>It may be observed, also, that the statutes of Delaware,
Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas do not
expressly include Indian slaves; but probably only a
few slaves are of pure Indian blood. Those of mixed
Indian descent would undoubtedly be classed with mulattoes,
and share their incapacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<h3>ECCENTRICITIES OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS.</h3>

<p>The rule is seen also in judicial decisions, which may be
classed among the eccentricities of jurisprudence. Subtilty
is a common attribute of courts, but in these cases
subtilty at times becomes fantastic. Reading them, we
may well confess that truth is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>Thus, although slaves are not permitted to testify, their
conversation or declarations may, under certain circumstances,
be admitted in evidence. For instance, according
to a decision in Missouri, if a white person converses
with a slave, the conversation, being otherwise admissible,
may be proved by any other white person who heard
it. In this case, Judge Scott said: “That negroes cannot
testify against white persons is clear; but this rule
cannot be carried so far as to exclude the conversation
of a negro with a white person, when the conversation
on the part of the negro is merely given in evidence as
an inducement and in illustration of what was said by
the white person. If the conversation of the negro had
been proved by herself, then it would clearly have been
illegal. Here the State proved by competent witnesses
that certain remarks were made to the plaintiff in error
in order to show what her reply was. It is a matter of
indifference by whom they were made. All that was
required was to prove by competent evidence that they
were made. That they were made is a fact which may
be proved like any other fact in the cause.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>On the same principle, it has been decided that any
remarks by a slave to a white person, calling for some
reply on the part of the latter, may be proved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
testimony of white persons, in order to show the nature
of that reply, or that none was made. The question
arose on an indictment for enticing a slave, when Judge
Goldthwaite said: “The question which the Court is
called upon to determine is simply whether the admission
of a white man to the truth of any statement made
by a slave in his presence and hearing can be inferred
from his silence. The rule in relation to evidence of
this character, so far as we are able to deduce it from
adjudged cases and the best elementary writers, is, that
the statement must be heard and understood by the
party affected by it, that the truth of the facts embraced
in it must be within his knowledge, and that the
statement must be made under such circumstances and
by such persons as naturally to call for a reply. To reject
the evidence in the case under consideration, solely
on the ground that the party making the declaration
was a slave, would be in effect to decide that under no
conceivable circumstances could a statement made by
a slave call for a response from a white man,&mdash;a proposition
in direct opposition to our daily observation and
experience. That the declaration was made by a person
whose condition rendered him incompetent as a witness
does not in the slightest degree affect the principle on
which evidence of this character rests. If the declaration
was made by a slave, and the party affected by it
had made by his reply a direct admission of its truth,
there could be no doubt of the admissibility of the statement
and reply; and in cases of implied admissions, the
admission, instead of being made by language, is made
by the silence of the party.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>There seems no end to the illustrations of this exclusion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as, for instance, when a colored woman acted as
interpreter between a testator and the person who
drafted the will. In this case, Judge Lumpkin said:
“We hold, that, if a negro interpreter, incapable by
law of being sworn, is the <em>only</em> channel of communication
between the testator and writer of the will, and
there be no other evidence of the testator’s knowledge
of its contents or his assent thereto than that which is
derived through this medium, the will cannot be executed.
But if the will be written in the presence of the
testator, and, in a language which he understands, it is
read over to him, and his dictation and approval of the
instrument are interpreted by a negro in his hearing,
and in the hearing of others interested in its contents,
and he signifies no dissent thereto by signs or otherwise,
but, on the contrary, is understood to express himself
satisfied, the will may be established, especially if it
appears to have been made in conformity to the previously
declared intentions of the testator as to the disposition
of his property.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>It has been decided that the incapacity of a free colored
person will not prevent him, even in a proceeding
against a white person, from making an affidavit required
to obtain a continuance, a new trial, absent testimony,
or bail, or from swearing to a plea of <i>non est factum</i>.
He may also bind a white person to keep the peace, or
make affidavit for a writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>; and generally
he may make such affidavits as may be necessary to
commence a suit, or to procure such orders or steps to
be taken therein as may be required to bring on a trial.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Without this capacity, he would, according to Chief Justice
Robertson, of Kentucky, “be virtually disfranchised.”
But the Chief Justice adds, that, when he is swearing to
facts against a white man, to compel him to keep the
peace, “he is not a witness, but a party swearing to
what any other party may.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And thus his incapacity
as witness is still recognized.</p>

<p>In another class of cases, where it became necessary
to show the mental condition or bodily health of the
slave, his declarations have been held to be admissible,
even in a suit against a white person; but they must
be proved by white testimony. Thus, in an action for
breach of covenant in not teaching a slave bound apprentice
to the business of coach-making, the defendant
having offered to prove, that, when he wished to instruct
the slave, and threatened to punish him, if he did not
apply himself, the latter, as soon as the defendant was
out of the way, would declare “that he did [not] care
about learning the trade, it was no profit to him, and
if he could avoid the lash, it was all he cared for,”&mdash;it
was held by that prominent magistrate, Mr. Justice
Gaston, of North Carolina, that the declarations of the
slave were admissible, “because his disposition and temper
are subjects of investigation, and these cannot be
ascertained but through the medium of such external
signs.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In another case the same question occurred
under these circumstances: A slave was hired by his
master to work in certain gold mines; but, while busy
at the bottom of a shaft one hundred and eighty feet
deep, he was struck on the head by an iron drill weighing
five pounds, which fell from the top, and his skull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was fractured so that trepanning became necessary, and
“a large piece of the skull-bone was cut out.” In an
action by the master for damages, Judge Pearson commented
on this rule of evidence: “It being material to
ascertain the bodily condition of the slave, his complaints
of headache when exposed to the sun, and his
declarations that he was unable to work in the sun or
to endure hard labor are admissible.… The statute
excluding the testimony of a slave or free person of
color against a white man has no application. The distinction
between natural evidence and personal evidence,
or the testimony of witnesses, is clear and palpable. The
actions, looks, and barking of a dog are admissible as
natural evidence upon a question as to his madness. So
the squealing and grunts or other expression of pain
made by a hog are admissible upon a question as to the
extent of an injury inflicted on him. This can in no
sense be called the testimony of the dog or the hog.
The only advantage of this natural evidence, when furnished
by brutes, over the same kind of evidence, when
furnished by human beings, whether white or black, is,
that the latter, having intelligence, may possibly have a
motive for dissimulation, whereas brutes have not; but
the character of the evidence is the same, and the jury
must pass upon its credit.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The same principle has been recognized in still another
case, where the slave died of mortification in the
bowels, and no physician was called in until the day
before his death, although his illness had continued
for three weeks. On this occasion Judge Green said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
“The statement of a sick slave as to the seat of his
pain, the nature, symptoms, and effects of his malady,
is as well calculated to illustrate the character of his
disease as would be the statements of any other person.
They are, therefore, equally admissible for that purpose.
But whether expressions indicating the nature and effects
of a disease uttered by the sick person are real or
feigned is for the jury to determine.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> And this principle
has also been recognized in suits for breach of covenant
in the warranty of a slave, or for fraud in the sale
of a slave.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But if the master distinctly warrants the
slave sound, he is not allowed to relieve himself of liability
for this false warranty by declarations of the slave
to the purchaser that he is diseased. A curious case
occurred in Kentucky, which illustrates this principle,
and also the brutality of Slavery. A poor slave woman
was very ill, when her master formed “the intention of
selling her, lest he should lose her value by death.”
Notwithstanding her pitiable condition, he succeeded in
disposing of her for two hundred dollars, one quarter in
a note and the remainder in saddle-trees, on the representation
that she was “hearty and sound, and fit for
business.” Although the slave woman, before the sale,
told the purchaser of her sickness, the Court annulled
the sale, and directed the note and the price of the saddle-trees
to be given up, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> “The slave herself told
the purchaser of her sickness before the sale; and after
the sale, when informed by him that he had bought her,
she stated she could not be of any use to him, as she
was near death. When it is recollected that frequently,
on such occasions, there is a strong indisposition in such
creatures to be sold, and that by stratagem, to avoid a
sale, they may frequently feign sickness, or magnify any
particular complaint with which they are affected, the
purchaser might well disbelieve her story, especially
when the words of the master assured him to the contrary.
For his own statements the master is responsible,
and ought not to be permitted to release himself
of responsibility for his own falsehoods by showing that
the slave at the time so far corrected him as to tell the
truth.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The principle underlying the admission of the declarations
of a slave is plainly, but brutally, expressed
by Judge Pearson, of North Carolina. We have already
seen, that, according to this learned judge, who was for
the time the voice of the law, the declarations of the
slave are not to be regarded as his <em>testimony</em>, any more
than the barking of a dog or the grunting of a hog “can
be called the testimony of the dog or the hog.” The
slave complains of his sickness in words, the dog moans,
the hog squeals; but the law regards these expressions
of suffering alike. They may be proved as facts by
competent evidence; but the slave himself cannot testify
what his complaints were, any more than the dog
or the hog.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Such are eccentricities of judicial opinion on this important
question. They are not to be regarded merely
as curiosities, for they are all adopted and enforced in
the national courts; so that even the most brutal language
becomes not merely the voice of the law, but the
voice of the nation also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h3>CONSEQUENCES OF THIS EXCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Thus do decisions of courts, as well as statutes, conspire
to exhibit this rule in revolting features. If we
glance for one moment at its consequences, there will be
new occasion to condemn it.</p>

<p>Looking at it in a single aspect, consequences appear
which baffle the imagination to picture. Throughout
the States where this exclusion prevails, any white person
may torture and maltreat a slave in any conceivable
manner and to any extent, or he may overwork and
starve him, or he may whip him to death, murder him
in cold blood, or burn him alive; and so long as he is
the only white person present, the laws afford him the
most complete immunity from punishment, except in
Delaware and Louisiana, where also he is safe, if only
slaves are present. It is true that the same laws profess
to punish the murder of a slave as a capital offence,
and also to punish severely any mutilation or other
cruel treatment of him. But such laws are nothing.
So long as the slave himself is not allowed to testify,
so long the laws will be justly obnoxious to the charge
of actually authorizing a white person to inflict any
outrage upon him, even to the extent of taking life with
impunity. Every white person with only slaves about
him, or, it may be, with only colored persons, slave
or free, has <em>a letter of license</em> to commit any outrage
which passion or wickedness may prompt.</p>

<p>The exposed condition of slaves, on account of incapacity
to testify, was recognized in the early legislation
of South Carolina. The preamble to Section 39 of the
Act of 1740 begins as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> “And whereas, by reason
of the extent and distance of plantations in this Province,
the inhabitants are far removed from each other,
<em>and many cruelties may be committed on slaves, because
no white person may be present to give evidence of the
same</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Thus, even out of the mouth of South Carolina,
before this State had learned to sacrifice everything
to Slavery, we learn that “many cruelties may
be committed on slaves” under operation of this rule.
But no such confession was needed. The truth is apparent
to the most superficial observer. Had South Carolina,
at that early day, followed the suggestion of her own
statute, she would have begun a career of civilization
under which Slavery itself must have disappeared.</p>

<p>The exposed condition of slaves on this account is
curiously attested by other statutes of the Slave States,
showing that plantations far removed from cities, and at
considerable distance from each other, are committed to
the direction of <em>a single white overseer</em>, who, from the circumstance
that he is the only white person present, is
placed beyond all restraint or correction. Thus, in South
Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in Florida,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in Georgia,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and in Louisiana,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the
statutes exact the continued residence of <em>one white person</em>
on every plantation, with a specified number of working
slaves. These statutes had their origin in no sentiment
of justice or humanity, but, as appears in early
declarations, in a desire to prevent the harboring of
fugitive slaves, who might find asylum among those exclusively
of their own color. If, however, it was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
necessary for any purpose to require by penalties the
continued residence of <em>even one white person</em> on a slave
plantation, it is reasonable to infer that there must be
many plantations where there is only one white person.
And to one white person thus situated, and thus removed
from all check or observation, the law commits the government
and guardianship of slaves on a plantation, and
promises him in advance the most complete impunity
for all that he does, even to the extent of cold-blooded
murder, provided only that he is careful to let no white
person see the deed.</p>

<p>This proscription is not confined to slaves. Free colored
persons, under operation of this rule, are exposed
to the same fearful wrongs. A white person may treat
them as he treats a slave, and they are absolutely without
remedy. It would be difficult to point out any law,
the spawn of cruelty or tyranny, in ancient or modern
times, exceeding in atrocity that by which a free population
is thus despoiled of protection on account of color.
It was one of the boasts of Magna Charta that justice
should be denied to no person,&mdash;“<i>Nulli negabimus justitiam</i>”;
but under this rule it is denied to a whole race.</p>

<p>Of course, the race, whether bond or free, which is
thus despoiled, suffers. But this is not all. Justice itself
also suffers. Crime, even against white persons in
the presence of colored persons, must go unpunished.</p>

<p>And yet this proscription is adopted and enforced in
the courts of the United States.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of this subject which invite
attention. History has her lessons. Reason also speaks
with a voice that must be heard. It becomes important,
therefore, to consider this proscription, first, in its
origin and the examples of history, and, secondly, in
the grounds on which it is founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>


<h3>EXAMPLES OF HISTORY.</h3>

<p>This proscription, or its equivalent, is traced to the
earliest age. It belongs to the Barbarism of Slavery.
Even as applied to free colored persons, it must be
considered as a relic of Slavery not yet removed out
of sight.</p>

<p>The rule may also be treated as belonging to that
system of evidence which, in defiance of reason, undertook
to declare in advance that certain classes of witnesses
were incompetent to testify,&mdash;or, in other words,
that the court and jury should not be permitted to hear
what they had to say on the issue. In the early Common
Law numbers were excluded who are now admitted
to testify; and the Committee cannot err, when they
declare that the plain tendency of recent legislation, and
also of judicial decisions, in England and in the United
States, has been to limit the exclusion of witnesses, allowing
the court and jury, on hearing their testimony,
to estimate its weight and value. The whole system of
exclusion was covered with ridicule by Jeremy Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
who exposed its irrational character. In our own country
it has been treated in a similar spirit, in a series of
masterly essays on the Rules of Evidence, by the present
learned Chief Justice of Maine, Hon. John Appleton.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Its origin may be traced to ignorance and prejudice.
There was a time, when, in Great Britain, at least on the
borders of England and Scotland, “an Englishman could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not be a witness against a Scot, nor a Scot against an
Englishman, by reason of the enmity between the two
nations; … so that, if never so many Englishmen
should with their open eyes see a Scot commit murder,
their testimony would signify nothing, unless some Scot
or other testified the same thing.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But their exclusion
in this historic case was identical in principle and consequence
with that still receiving the sanction of Congress.</p>

<p>This whole body of cases has been despatched by
Jeremy Bentham in these words: “Exclusion put upon
all persons of this or that particular description <em>includes
a license to commit</em>, in the presence of any number of
persons of that description, <em>all imaginable crimes</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The
Psalmist exclaims: “I said in my haste all men are
liars.” But the malediction of the Psalmist in his haste
is gravely adopted in this proscription, which undertakes
to blast “all men” of a specified description as “liars.”
Assuming that all of a certain class or race or color cannot
be believed on oath, it practically says, that, though
present <em>in point of fact</em> at any crime, they are absent
<em>in point of law</em>.</p>

<p>By the Mohammedan Law, no person could be convicted
of adultery without the testimony of <em>four male
witnesses</em>,&mdash;a requirement which was called by Gibbon
“a law of domestic peace.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The extravagance of this
requirement rendered it practically a law to prevent
conviction, not unlike the law excluding testimony. It
is a disguised exclusion. But of the two, the Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Law is the least irrational. At all events, it does
not assume the form of proscription.</p>

<p>The rule of exclusion, when founded on race or color,
is something more than a rule of evidence from which
justice may suffer. It is a proscription, which finds prototypes
in other countries and times, kindred in character
to the persecution of the Moors in Spain, and to that
cruelty which for ages pursued the Jews everywhere,
while it reveals that insensibility to the claims of a
common humanity which has so slowly yielded to the
demands of a just civilization. In France, during the
last century, even after politeness had begun to prevail,
it is recorded of a most intellectual lady, the commentator
upon Newton, Madame du Châtelet, that she did
not hesitate to undress before her male domestics, as it
did not seem clear that such persons were men.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But
it is in the irreligious system of Caste, as established
in India, that we find the most perfect parallel. Indeed,
the late Alexander von Humboldt, in speaking of
colored persons, has designated them as a Caste;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and
a political and juridical writer of France has used the
same term to denote not only the distinctions in India,
but those in our own country, which he characterizes
as “humiliating and brutal.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> But the Caste of India,
by which the Brahmins and Sudras have been kept
apart, is already repudiated by Christian civilization as
“part and parcel of idolatry.” Bishop Heber, of Calcutta,
says of this injustice, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> “a system which tends
more than anything else the Devil has yet invented to
destroy the feelings of general benevolence, and to make
nine tenths of mankind the hopeless slaves of the
remainder.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But the language with which this accomplished
bishop condemns the heathen Caste of India is
not inapplicable to that other Caste in our own country,
which, in one of its incidents, despoils the colored person
of his right to testify.</p>

<p>If we go back to the ancient Greeks, we find an interesting
distinction. A slave was not believed on oath;
so that one is recorded as exclaiming, in words which
might be adopted in our day: “I know I am a slave:
I don’t know even what I do know.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But, though
not believed on oath, his evidence was always taken
with torture. On this account his testimony appears
to have been considered of more value even than that
of a freeman. Isæus, in arguing a case, said: “When
slaves and freemen are at hand, you do not make use
of the testimony of freemen; but, putting slaves to
the torture, you thus endeavor to find out the truth
of what has been done.” Any person might offer his
own slave to be examined by torture, or demand the
same thing of his adversary, and the refusal of the latter
was regarded as a strong presumption against him.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Thus cruelly did this sharp people seek to counteract
the senseless rule of exclusion. Torture was recognized,
but justice was not absolutely sacrificed.</p>

<p>The Romans seem to have borrowed the practice from
the Greeks, or they were inspired to kindred cruelty.
Not only slaves, but even free persons of an inferior
condition, were seldom examined except under torture.
Any person who wished the testimony of a slave might
obtain it on giving sufficient security to the master for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
full reparation on account of damage from his torture.
Mr. Jefferson states mildly our own practice, in contrast
with that of Rome, when he says: “With the Romans,
the regular method of taking the evidence of their slaves
was under torture; here it has been thought better never
to resort to their evidence.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In the latter days of the
Empire, a general rule made the slave inadmissible as
witness for or against his master or his master’s children,
except in cases of treason, where the danger of the
crime overruled ordinary considerations, and also in cases
of incest and adultery, for the good reason that <em>in a
society where all domestics were slaves any other evidence
could hardly be procured</em>.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> But the latter reason might
obviously exist in the case of any crime; so that, on
principle, when other proofs were wanting, resort might
be had to the testimony of slaves. Indeed, a learned
commentator on the Roman Law has distinctly said
that this law did not admit slaves to be witnesses, unless
the cause was difficult, looking to the welfare of
the republic, <em>or other proofs were wanting</em>: “<i>Servos lex
civilis non patitur testes esse, … nisi causa sit ardua,
ad rei publicæ spectans utilitatem, aut aliæ desint probationes.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
It became customary, in civil matters, to
admit the testimony of slaves as to their own acts, although
affecting the interests of their masters; and after
the establishment of Christianity, when heresy took
its place as a crime to be dreaded as much as treason,
the testimony of slaves was received equally with regard
to each.</p>

<p>The rule of exclusion during the Dark Ages naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
took its character from the prevailing darkness. The
Barbarians did not, in this respect, soften the law of
ancient Rome. Amidst the cares of empire this task
was attempted by Charlemagne; but how little he accomplished
may be seen in his Capitularies, where slaves
are rejected as witnesses against their masters, except
in cases of treason, and even freedmen, unless in the
third generation, are not admitted to testify against freemen.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
And the same intolerance is attributed to the
Canon Law: “<i>Item placuit, ut omnes servi vel proprii
liberti ad accusationem non admittantur</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But it appears
that at this time, among some races, it was the
prerogative of royal serfs, and of others not of base condition,
to have their testimony received against freemen,
especially in cases of childbirth, violence, or death by
accident.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And the influence of the clergy seems to have
overruled this exclusion in certain specified districts.
Thus, in 1109, on the petition of the ecclesiastics of
Paris, Louis the Sixth conceded to the serfs of the latter
a perfect liberty of testifying and combating (<i>testificandi
et bellandi</i>) against freemen as well as slaves;
and this important concession was confirmed by the
Pope, who declared, however, that there ought to be a
difference in the conditions governing a family of the
Church and the slaves of secular persons.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Although
this concession was made for the sake of the Church
rather than its humble dependants, it was an example
by which the world became accustomed to receive the
testimony of slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>In England, under the Common Law, the rule of
exclusion on account of Slavery was never fully recognized.
The villein seems to have been admitted as a
witness in all cases except against his lord. “I do not
know,” says Mr. Hallam, “that their testimony, except
against their lord, was ever refused in England.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It was
only in respect of his lord that he was without rights.
But he was sometimes received, although the lord himself
was a party;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and in criminal cases generally it
was no exception to a witness that he was a bondman.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Such, even at the beginning, was the voice of the Common
Law. But with the disappearance of villenage
all pretence of exclusion on this account vanished in
England, never to return.</p>

<p>The offensive rule seems to have found less acceptance
in the possessions of other countries than with us.
It has been inferred, after careful inquiry, that slaves
in the Spanish and Portuguese settlements are not always
incompetent as witnesses, while the <i>Code Noir</i> of
Louis the Fourteenth, amidst ungenerous prohibitions,
allowed their evidence to be heard, “as a suggestion, or
unauthenticated information, which might throw light
on the evidence of other witnesses,” and afterwards, by
later edict, sanctioned the testimony of slaves, “when
white witnesses were wanting, except against their
masters.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> But the rule is the natural complement of
Slavery; and it cannot be disguised that it has prevailed,
with corresponding degrees of force, wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Slavery has been recognized. Its prevalence with us
is only another illustration of the power of Slavery.</p>

<p>If you would find the country where slaves have been
most completely despoiled of the right of testimony, you
will not go to Greece or Rome, for in these classic lands
the slaves were admitted to testify in certain cases; nor
will you linger even in the Dark Ages, for there were then
excepted cases; nor will you search English precedents,
for the villein was incompetent only against his lord,
and not always against him; nor will you look to the
colonies of Spain, Portugal, or France, for in all of these
the cruel rule was mitigated; but you will turn to those
States of our Republic where the slave is not permitted
to testify against his master or any other white person,
and where even free colored persons, having no master,
are smitten with the same incapacity to testify against
any white person.</p>


<h3>GROUNDS FOR THIS INJUSTICE.</h3>

<p>From examples of history the way is easy to an inquiry
into the grounds on which this proscription is
founded.</p>

<p>The true reason may be traced to the unhappy prejudices
engendered by Slavery, and to the policy of sustaining
this wrong. Indeed, it is hardly less essential
to Slavery than the lash itself. An early statute of
Virginia places the rule on the ground that none but
Christians should be witnesses, and even among these
“Popish recusants convict” were inadmissible.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
it is generally vindicated by dwelling on <i>the degraded
condition of the slave, and the interest he may have to
conceal or deny the truth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> A careful examination will
show that this apology is baseless as Slavery itself.</p>

<p>Of course, if a witness is too degraded to feel the
sanction of an oath, his testimony should not be received.
Such is the unquestionable suggestion of reason;
nor can it make any difference that the witness is
white or black. But the slave is not necessarily and
universally so degraded as to merit exclusion, nor is his
interest to conceal or deny the truth different materially
from that of other persons,&mdash;although it is undoubtedly
true, that, under the instinct of self-defence, and
against the exactions of Slavery, he learns to deceive.
But in every State except South Carolina <em>the oath of the
slave is received against colored persons</em>, which could not
be done, if he could not be trusted under oath. A judge
of South Carolina has vindicated the capacity of the slave
in this respect, and thus unintentionally repelled the
rule of exclusion. “Negroes, slaves or free,” says Judge
O’Neall, “will feel the sanction of an oath with as much
force as any of the ignorant classes of white people in
a Christian country. They ought, too, to be made to
know, if they testify falsely, they are to be punished for
it by human laws. The course pursued on the trial
of negroes, in the abduction and obtaining testimony,
leads to none of the certainties of truth. Falsehood is
often the result, and innocence is thus often sacrificed
on the shrine of prejudice.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But this learned judge of
South Carolina is not alone in vindicating the propriety
of examining the slave on oath. Judge Clayton, of the
High Court of Errors and Appeals in Mississippi, in delivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the opinion of the Court, thus expressed himself:
“It is also objected, that there ought, in the case
of slaves, to be some evidence of a sense of religious
accountability, upon which the validity of all testimony
rests, and that the same presumption of such religious
belief cannot be indulged in reference to them as in regard
to white persons. As to the latter, it is said the
presumption is in favor of their proper religious culture
and belief in revelation and a future state of rewards
and punishments; as to slaves, it is contended the presumption
does not arise, because of a defect of religious
education. It is true, that, if the declarant had no sense
of future responsibility, his declarations would not be
admissible. But the absence of such belief must be
shown. The simple elementary truths of Christianity,
the immortality of the soul and a future accountability,
are generally received and believed by this portion of
our population. From the pulpit many, perhaps all,
who attain maturity, hear these doctrines announced
and enforced, and embrace them as articles of faith.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>But if slaves generally have a sufficient amount of
religious belief to supply the sanction of an oath, it is
clear that they are not so degraded as to justify their
exclusion as sworn witnesses. And the Slave States,
while excluding them, have practically recognized their
fitness. Not only is the oath of a slave received in all
the Slave States except South Carolina, but he is liable
to punishment for perjury,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and sometimes the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
inflicted is diabolic. In Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and also in
Maryland,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the punishment formerly was “cropping.”
In Florida, the statute appoints that the offender “shall
have his or her ears nailed to posts, and there to stand
for one hour, and, moreover, receive thirty-nine lashes
on his or <em>her bare back</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In Mississippi, if a colored
person is found to have given false testimony, he is “to
have one ear nailed to the pillory, and there to stand for
the space of one hour, and then the said ear to be cut
off, and thereafter the other ear nailed in like manner,
and cut off at the expiration of one other hour; and,
moreover, to receive thirty-nine lashes on his or <em>her bare
back</em>, well laid on, at the public whipping-post, or such
other punishment as the court shall think proper, not
extending to life or limb.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But every recognition of
the oath of a slave on any occasion, and especially every
punishment of a slave for perjury, testifies to his capacity
as a witness. The barbarism of the punishment testifies
also against Slavery. It is vain to say that a slave
is incompetent, when, in certain cases, he is already accepted
as witness, and visited with fiendish punishment,
if he violates his oath.</p>

<p>The absurdity of this pretension is illustrated by a
provision in the statutes of Kentucky, by which a slave
in the penitentiary may be a competent witness against
a white convict.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Such was early the law of Virginia,
and even now he is competent for the white convict.
Thus, so long as a slave commits no crime, his oath is
not received in court to affect a white person even with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the smallest pecuniary liability; but let him be sent to
the penitentiary as a convict for crime, and forthwith his
capacity as a witness is enlarged, and on his testimony
a white convict may be deprived of life! But, obviously,
the commission of a crime carrying with it the doom of
the penitentiary must impair rather than increase confidence
in the veracity of the criminal. Such is the absurd
inconsistency in the application of this rule.</p>

<p>Although the rule may be properly traced to Slavery,
of which it is an important ally, yet, from considerations
already presented, it seems to follow that it is founded
on a reason broader than Slavery, suggested, however,
by Slavery. According to the logic of these considerations,
the disqualification of the slave as a witness against
white persons is not founded on the fact that he is a
slave, because the disqualification, except in Delaware
and Louisiana, attaches also to free colored persons; nor
is it founded on want of that religious belief required in
a sworn witness, nor on any actual disregard of his testimony
under oath, because the slave in certain cases is
sworn, and his testimony under oath is accepted in the
administration of justice, and he is punished for perjury;
but it is simply, in the last analysis, <em>an incapacity attached
by law to persons of color</em>. Indeed, the obvious
inference from the remarks of Judge O’Neall<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> is, that,
in his opinion, it is not slavery, but color, which is the
ground of exclusion. But the Committee have already
shown the pernicious consequences of such proscription,
and especially that the disfranchisement of the
African race operates as a liberty to all white persons,
not excepting, in most of the States, even white convicts,
to do as they please, and commit any crime in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the Decalogue, “unwhipped of justice,” if nobody but a
colored person is present. It needs no argument to establish
the unreasonableness of a disqualification which,
according to the confession of its advocates, attaches to
the shading of the human skin, especially in view of the
fearful cruelty that is its natural consequence.</p>

<p>In Delaware and Louisiana the disqualification rests
on the fact of Slavery. In many other States the free
colored persons are so few in number that the fact of
Slavery seems still to overshadow the whole race. Assuming,
then, that the disqualification is traced not
merely to the shading of the skin, but to the fact of
Slavery, it is none the less to be rejected, not only as part
of Slavery, but as essentially irrational and inhuman.</p>

<p>The slave feels the sanction of an oath hardly less
than many white persons of inferior condition. On
grounds of reason, therefore, and independently of prejudice,
the two classes at the outset would be entitled to
an equal degree of confidence,&mdash;modified, of course, and
decreasing, as there was a manifest interest or temptation
to testify falsely. But the slave is exposed to
such corrupting power less than a white person. He
can have no pecuniary interest, since he has no right of
property. And, except where his master is a party or
otherwise interested, he must be alike without hope
of gain or fear of punishment to make him swerve from
the truth. Accordingly, in all cases where his master
stands indifferent, the reason for excluding the slave is
not so strong as for excluding white persons of inferior
condition, since the slave may feel the sanction of an
oath as much as they, while he is less exposed to any
disturbing influence. Such, certainly, is the conclusion
justified by the facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The dependence of the slave upon his master must
naturally subject him peculiarly to his influence, whether
from hope of reward or fear of punishment; so that
his testimony in favor of his master would always be
viewed with suspicion. If, contrary to this active interest,
the slave testifies <em>against</em> his master, his testimony
would seem to be worthy of peculiar consideration. But
even where he testifies <em>for</em> his master, there can be no
more reason for excluding his testimony than for excluding
that of a child for a father or a mother, or of
excluding that of a father or a mother for a child. Unquestionably,
in each of these cases the bias is stronger
than any that can exist on the part of a slave, as love
is stronger than fear. Therefore there is no valid reason
why a slave should not be permitted to testify <em>for</em>
or <em>against</em> his master. The same considerations which
determine the value of other testimony will suffice with
regard to him; and thus, in every respect, the rule of
exclusion becomes irrational and arbitrary.</p>

<p>But this rule, whether applicable to slaves or free
colored persons, is still more irrational and unwarranted
when it is considered that the testimony is submitted to
the scrutiny of a jury of white persons, under the watchful
observation of a court of white persons likewise, and
that it can have no effect whatever except through assent
of their judgment. The motive which actuates the
slave, whatever it may be, whether revenge or interest
or fear, must be open to discovery. It is therefore preposterous
to argue that any white person, at any time
or anywhere, especially in a Slave State, can be prejudiced
by colored testimony, or that he can be convicted
by a white jury under the eye of a white court, unless
that testimony is strictly worthy of belief. The rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
exclusion is not only an expression of tyranny and prejudice,
but an insult to the understanding, and even to
common sense.</p>

<p>If this rule were only irrational and eccentric, it might
be pardoned to immeasurable madness, and handed over
to the derision of mankind. But even its absurdity disappears
in its appalling injustice. Two things are obvious
to the most superficial observation: first, that under
its influence the slave is left absolutely without legal
protection of any kind, the victim of lawless outrage;
and, secondly, that even crimes against white persons
may escape unpunished: so that in these two important
cases justice must fail. But this failure of justice becomes
intolerable, when it is considered that it is not
from accident or temporary weakness, but that it is absolutely
organized by law. Nor is it confined to slaves.
It embraces in its ban free colored persons also, without
regard to intelligence, property, or relations in life.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Such is this proscription, as it appears (1.) in the various
statutes of the Slave States, (2.) in the eccentricities
of judicial decisions, (3.) in its consequences, (4.) in examples
of history, and (5.) in the grounds on which it
is founded. Regarding it in either of these aspects, it
must be rejected. The statutes in which it is declared
and the judicial eccentricities by which it is illustrated
belong to the curiosities of an expiring barbarism. Its
consequences shock the conscience of the world. The
examples of history testify against it. The reason on
which it is founded shows that it stands on nothing
that is reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is for Congress to determine whether this proscription
shall continue in the courts of the United States,&mdash;or,
in other words, if a local rule, barbarous, irrational,
and unjust, born of Slavery, shall be allowed to exist
yet longer under the national sanction.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on an Amendment to the Consular and
Diplomatic Appropriation Bill, March 15, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 14th, the Senate having under consideration the bill making
appropriations for the consular and diplomatic service, Mr. Sumner, in
behalf of the Committee on Foreign Relations, moved the following
amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the President may, in his discretion, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, appoint an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
to the kingdom of Belgium, who shall receive no higher compensation
than is now allowed to a minister resident.”</p>

</div>

<p>The amendment was opposed by Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, to whom
Mr. Sumner replied.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>March 15th, the debate was continued, and Mr. Sumner spoke several
times. In reply to Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There seems a perpetual disposition
in this debate to change the issue. I
stated that the issue was how we shall best give efficiency
to our representation in Europe. Now the Senator
from Kentucky says that the issue is how we shall
give our minister at Belgium an opportunity to get into
a little better company. That is his imagination. Surely
it is not the way the Committee directed me to state the
case. It is not the way in which I have presented it at
any time in this discussion. I hope that Senators will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
not be diverted from the real issue, which is simply, Will
the public interests be promoted by this change? The
Committee answer in the affirmative, and in my humble
opinion the Committee is right.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Will the Chairman specify in what respect
the public interest will be promoted, in what respect the
efficiency of our representative at the court of Brussels will
be increased, and in what respect the increase of his grade
will render this Government and its interests more acceptable
to Leopold?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> In the same way, Sir, that the public interests
are promoted at London, and also at Paris, by a plenipotentiary
instead of a minister resident.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> According to that rule, we ought to have a
first-class minister at every court in Europe and at every
government in South America, and everywhere else where
we send diplomatic representatives.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> No,&mdash;the Senator will pardon me,&mdash;not
at every court in Europe, but only at those where we have
considerable interests. It all pivots upon that. What are
our relations with different courts? With considerable interests,
we should be represented accordingly. With inconsiderable
interests only, there is no reason to raise the mission.
We have first-class missions, according to our scale
of rank, at London, Paris, Madrid, Turin, Vienna, Berlin,
and St. Petersburg. And why?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Will the honorable Chairman tell me the relative
proportion between the commercial interests of the
United States and England, the United States and France,
and the United States and Belgium?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There are interests of all kinds, commercial
and political, differing in different countries. I need not remind
the Senator that our interests with England and France
are largely superior to those with any other European power,&mdash;much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
above those with Belgium; but if you ask me what
other European power I should place next after those two,
I should hesitate, in the condition of our affairs at this precise
moment, to place any before Belgium.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Would you not place Russia before Belgium?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I would not exaggerate, but I am
obliged to acknowledge, in reply to the Senator, that I
should hesitate at this moment to say that even Russia
was so situated as to make our minister there so
important to our present interests as our minister at
Belgium. In one word, our minister at Brussels has
more to do than our minister at St. Petersburg. Look
I pray you, at the geographical position of Belgium,
its thronging, active population, its commerce, its manufactures.
But countries derive character and even
power from their rulers, and this is the happy advantage
of Belgium, especially in her relations with us.
You all know that her sovereign is able to exercise a
persuasive influence over international affairs, entirely
out of proportion to the extent of territory he so wisely
governs, and this influence has been exerted at a critical
moment in our favor.</p>

<p>I would not say a word in disparagement of any other
power. But it would be difficult, after England and
France, to name any power which, all things considered,
furnishes at this moment such opportunities of usefulness
in the public service to any American plenipotentiary
as are afforded by Belgium. Would the Senator
compare our interests there with those in Prussia, one of
the most respectable and highly educated courts of the
globe, or with Austria, great in military power and physical
resources? At Berlin and Vienna there is less for
our ministers to do, and less of opportunity, than at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Brussels. The geographical position of these capitals
explains this difference, at least in part.</p>

<p>Or, if you please, take the government of Spain, representing
that great Castilian monarchy on which it
was said that the sun never set. A Senator whispers
that this was said some time ago. True; but you have
in Spain the old Castilian pride and faith born of that
immense empire; and yet our interests with Spain at
this moment, or, in other words, our opportunities in
that kingdom, are not more important than in the smaller
kingdom of Belgium, which the sun covers in much less
than a single hour.</p>

<p>Then there is the new-born kingdom of Italy, where
we have also a plenipotentiary. Does any one suppose,
that, if you put aside that sympathy which every American
feels for this interesting power, newly dedicated to
Liberty, our interests there at this moment are equal to
those with Belgium? Here again geography explains
the difference.</p>

<p>There only remains in this review, to which the Senator
invites me, the empire of Russia, bound by many
years of history to amity with the United States, and
absolutely fixed as our friend beyond any jar of diplomacy
or any jealousy of growing power. But our commercial
relations with this extensive country are inferior
to those with Belgium; and St. Petersburg is further removed
from the great centre of observation than Brussels.
The Emperor of Russia is illustrious from a transcendent
act, for which his name will be blessed; but
his assured regard for us takes away all solicitude as to
his policy, while the complications of present questions
in which he is involved render his relations to other
European governments less intimate than those of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Leopold, even if the latter had not, from family and long
experience, a position of peculiar weight in the scale of
European affairs, so that Belgium under his rule has a
value beyond her natural power or territorial extent.
Belgium may be small in domain, but so was Greece;
nor will any one presume to measure the influence her
sovereign may exercise by the number of square miles
he governs.</p>

<p>But the Senator asked if there was any other government
so small in numbers where we were represented
by a plenipotentiary. I have before me, from the last
almanac, the population of Chile, where we have a
plenipotentiary. It is one million five hundred and
fifty-eight thousand. Here, also, is the population of
Peru, where we have a plenipotentiary,&mdash;two million
five hundred thousand.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I believe that those missions ought to be
reduced, and I would vote to-day for the reduction of the
missions to Chile and to Peru.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well; but let us take each question
by itself. That is the more practical way. When
the proposition to reduce the missions to Chile and Peru
comes before the Senate, I shall be ready to meet it, and
I do not say that I shall differ from the Senator; but
that proposition is not now before us, nor is it involved
even indirectly in the pending amendment.</p>

<p>It is said, that, if we raise this mission, next year there
will be attempt to raise the salary. Very well; when
that comes, we can meet it. Again it is said that next
year there will be attempt to raise both mission and
salary at the Hague and other places. Very well; when
the time comes,&mdash;and it must have the sanction of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
committee of this body to come before the Senate,&mdash;we
will meet it. Meanwhile I ask you to consider the actual
question under debate, which is, whether you will
authorize the Government, in view of the peculiar circumstances
of the case and for the support of our interests
abroad, to raise the Belgian mission without any
increase of salary. I have said this too often, I know;
but I have been driven to it by the pertinacity with
which Senators have insisted upon presenting the case
in a false light.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 18,&mdash;and the bill
passed the Senate; but the House of Representatives would not consent
to raise the Belgian mission. Two different conference committees
were appointed. The first united in the following substitute, drawn
by Mr. Sumner, which would enable the President to raise the mission in
his discretion without increase of salary: “That an envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary, appointed at any place where the United
States are now represented by a minister resident, shall receive the compensation
fixed by law and appropriated for a minister resident, and
no more.” But this was disagreed to by the House, and at the second
conference the Senate receded from the amendment, so that it was lost.</p>

<p>In the next Congress it was renewed by Mr. Sumner, and prevailed.
It will be found in the Consular and Diplomatic Act of July 25, 1866.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

said in reply:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The chief objection of the
Senator from Maryland seemed to be that we
might educate these young men at the national expense
and very soon thereafter lose them,&mdash;in other words, not
get our money back. In the first place, it is very easy,
by regulations at the State Department before these
appointments, to provide against any such contingency;
and I understand that Mr. Marcy, indefatigable and ingenious
as the Senator remembers he was, did, by a series
of regulations, carefully provide for this very case.
Should we return to the original law, the Secretary of
State would have only to revive those original regulations
by one of his most distinguished predecessors. I
believe this a sufficient answer to the Senator.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Chandler</span>] has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
already answered him in another way, when he asked,
very pertinently, What assurance have we that we shall
enjoy the services of the cadets at West Point, or the
naval cadets now at Newport? There are certain requirements
of service, but the Senator knows well that
nothing is more common than for cadets, especially military,
to pass immediately from that education they have
received at the expense of their country into occupations
serving only their private advantage.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> That is with the consent of the Government.
The Government accepts their resignations.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well; what is to hinder regulations
at the Department of State requiring the consent
of the Government before these pupils shall be released,&mdash;in
short, holding them by some words of contract for
a certain term? Here let me say, that, unlike cadets,
these pupils will give the Government valuable service
even while pupils.</p>

<p>But, Sir, passing from these considerations, allow me
for a moment to ask the attention of the Senate to this
proposition in two aspects,&mdash;the first as a carrying out
of the consular and diplomatic statute of the United
States, and the second as in the nature of an educational
provision calculated to benefit our consular service
abroad.</p>

<p>In the first aspect, the Senate will bear in mind that
down to 1855 we had no general diplomatic and consular
statute. Our representation in foreign countries
went under thorough review, and the result was the
statute in our books, determining grades, adjusting salaries,
and, in one word, systematizing the whole business.
Let the character of the statute be borne in mind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
this statute, which aimed to present a complete system,
contained the provision for consular pupils.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, at that time and by that statute our consular
salaries were adjusted to this very provision of
consular pupils. The one was in the nature of a complement
to the other. The salaries were made lower
than they otherwise would have been in certain cases,
because the consuls were to be aided by pupils with a
compensation fixed by statute. But the provision for
pupils was repealed shortly afterwards, indeed before
the experiment had been tried, without, however, raising
the consular salaries in corresponding degree. It
seems clear that something must be done now. You
must do one of two things,&mdash;either raise the consular
salaries or appoint consular pupils. Otherwise the original
idea of the statute fails, and our system is defective.</p>

<p>But this seems to be the least important aspect of the
subject. A mere question of salary, or, if you please, of
system in the statute, is trivial, to my mind, by the side
of that other consideration to which Senators have already
alluded. I said that this was part of an educational
system for the advancement of our service abroad.
I do not think you can exaggerate its importance in this
respect. Let any one who has been abroad, or had personal
acquaintance with those who have been abroad,
bear testimony to the abounding ignorance in our foreign
service, from the circumstance that there is nobody
there, unless a hired foreigner, acquainted with the language,
the laws, or the usages of the people about him.
Sir, it is a shame that our offices abroad, whether consular
or diplomatic, are served in this inferior way. Here,
now, is a practical proposition beginning a remedy. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
is simple and direct. It seems to me that it cannot fail
to be of considerable advantage. The business of these
offices will be better done, and there will be a staff of
educated experts, familiar with foreign life, whose knowledge
and experience, even if not always in the service
of Government, will pass into the capital stock and
resources of the country. Nothing is clearer than that
the education of the people is a source of national wealth,
even of national power.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Vermont says that education is
needed more in the diplomatic service than in the consular.
Granted; it is needed very much in the diplomatic
service; but because needed there, is that any
reason why we should not supply it here? The argument,
it seems to me, was hardly worthy of that Senator.
Let a proposition be brought forward for an educational
system applicable to our diplomatic representatives,
and we will entertain it. Meanwhile let us act
on that before us, which, I submit, is eminently practical
in character. Who are our consuls? They are not
diplomatic or political agents in the common sense of
the term; they are commercial agents. To discharge
their duties fitly, they should be familiar with the interests
of commerce, how it is conducted, and the language
it employs, where they happen to be. And permit me
to say, that a great country like ours, one of whose chief
sources of wealth and of grandeur is commerce, must not
hesitate to supply the education needed to secure commercial
representatives not unworthy of the Republic
they represent.</p>

<p>As the consul is a commercial representative, he is on
this account especially the agent of a commercial country.
If our commerce were less, our interest in having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
good consuls would be less. But with the surpassing
growth of our commerce this interest enlarges. To send
abroad consuls without proper education must necessarily
bring the national character into disrepute, and
jeopard the concerns intrusted to them. For the sake
of our good name abroad, which is part of our national
possessions, and also for the sake of those vast commercial
concerns which encircle the globe, I hope that this
proposition, which is a small beginning in the right
direction, will not be rejected.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 16th, the debate was continued, and Mr. Sumner spoke again.
The amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 20, Nays 16,&mdash;and the bill passed
the Senate. The House disagreed to the amendment, but afterwards
accepted the report of a conference committee, authorizing the appointment
of “consular clerks, not exceeding thirteen in number at any one
time, who shall be citizens of the United States, and over eighteen years
of age at the time of their appointment, and shall be entitled to compensation
for their services respectively at a rate not exceeding one
thousand dollars per annum, to be determined by the President.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

OF REPRESENTATIVES.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Resolutions upon his Death,
March 29, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It is proposed to adjourn
in honor of <span class="smcap">Owen Lovejoy</span>, whose recent death
we mourn. Could his wishes prevail, Senators would
continue in their seats and help enact into law some
one of the several measures pending to secure the obliteration
of Slavery. Such an act would be more acceptable
to him than any personal tribute.</p>

<p>He spoke well always, but he believed in deeds rather
than words, although speech with him was a deed. It
was his contribution to that sublime cause for which he
toiled always. Words may be often “the daughters of
earth,” but there was little of earth in his. Proceeding
from a pure and generous heart, they have so far prevailed,
even during his life, that they must be named
gratefully among those good influences by which the
triumph has been won. How his enfranchised soul
would be elevated, even in those abodes to which he is
removed, at knowing that his voice is still heard on earth,
encouraging, exhorting, insisting that there shall be no
hesitation anywhere in striking at Slavery,&mdash;that this
unpardonable wrong, from which alone the Rebellion
draws its wicked life, must be blasted by Presidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
proclamation, blasted by Act of Congress, blasted by constitutional
prohibition, blasted in every possible way,
by every available agency, and at every occurring opportunity,
so that no trace of the outrage may continue
in the institutions of the land, and especially that its
accursed footprints may no longer defile the national
statute-book! In vain you pass resolutions in tribute
to him, if you neglect that cause for which he lived, and
hearken not to his voice.</p>

<p>Shortly before he went away from Washington to die,
I sat by his bedside. There, too, within call, was the
beloved partner of his life. He was cheerful; but his
thoughts were mainly turned to his country, whose fortunes
in the bloody conflict with Slavery he watched
with intensest care. He did not doubt the great result;
but he longed to be at his post again, to teach his fellow-citizens,
and to teach Congress, how vain to expect
an end of the Rebellion without making an end
of Slavery. It is only just to his fame that now, on this
occasion of commemoration, all this should be faithfully
told. To suppress it would be dishonest. I could not
speak at his funeral, if I were expected to unite in robbing
his grave of any of these honors derived from his
transcendent courage and discernment in the trials of
the present hour.</p>

<p>The Journals of the House show how faithfully he
began his labors at the present session. On the 14th
of December he introduced a bill, whose title discloses
its character: “A bill to give effect to the Declaration
of Independence, and also to certain provisions of the
Constitution of the United States.” It proceeds to recite
that all men are created equal, and endowed by the Creator
with the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
fruits of honest toil; that the Government of the United
States was instituted to secure those rights; that the
Constitution declares that no person shall be deprived
of liberty without due process of law, and also provides
(Article six, clause two) that “this Constitution, and
the laws of the United States which shall be made in
pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land,
and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,
anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding”; that it is now demonstrated
by the Rebellion that Slavery is absolutely incompatible
with the union, peace, and general welfare for which Congress
is to provide; and it therefore enacts that all persons
heretofore held in slavery in any of the States or Territories
of the United States are declared freedmen, and
are forever released from slavery or involuntary servitude,
except as punishment for crime on due conviction.
On the same day he introduced another bill, to protect
freedmen and to punish any one for enslaving them.
These were among his last public acts. And now they
testify how honestly he dealt with that <em>question of questions</em>
in which all other questions are swallowed up. It
is easy to see that he scorned the wicked fantasy that
man can hold property in man. This pernicious delusion,
which is the source of such intolerable pretensions
on the part of slave-masters, and, worse still, of such intolerable
irresolution on the part of many professing
opposition to Slavery, could get no hold of him. He
knew that it was a preposterous falsehood, as wicked as
false, born of prejudice and supreme credulity, and therefore
he brushed aside as cobweb all the fine-spun snares
of law or Constitution so ingeniously woven in its support.
Recognizing Freedom as the God-given birthright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of all who wear the human form, he knew no duty higher
than to protect it always; and to this end law and
Constitution must minister.</p>

<p>He had never been a judge, and was not even a lawyer,
so that the technicalities and subtilties of the profession
had no chance of enslaving him. Besides, to a
nature like his, independent and self-poised, what were
the sophisms of learning and skill, when employed in
the support of Wrong? It was enough, that, wherever
Slavery appeared, it was in defiance of that commanding
law of Right, before which all unjust pretensions,
whatever form they take, must disappear like the morning
dew under the flashing arrows of the ascending sun.
From the beginning and at all times he was fixed against
all compromise with Slavery, and stood like a fortress.
Sir, let it be spoken here in his honor. He lies cold in
death, but he could have no better epitaph than this:
“<em>Here rests one who would not compromise with Wrong</em>.”
When Senators and Presidents bent to the ignoble behest,
he stood firm. He was gifted to see that Slavery,
unlike Tariff or Bank, did not come within the
range of compromise any more than the Decalogue or
Multiplication Table. He saw well how shamefully
unconstitutional and inhuman was the Fugitive Slave
Act, in spite of every apology of compromise, and refused
it all support. He lies cold in death, but his
principles will live to sweep this unutterable atrocity
from the statute-book, which it still fills from cover to
cover with blackness.</p>

<p>He was not only a faithful counsellor of perfect loyalty,
in whom truth was a religion and an instinct, but
he was a counsellor whose experience of mankind and
of public life united with aptitude for affairs in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to what he said added value. He sat for several years
in the other House face to face with Slave-Masters, who
then ruled the country, so that he knew them well in
every respect, but especially in their open brutality and
surpassing effrontery. During this period, while shut
out from participation in the public business, his duty
was that of champion, and nobly did he perform it.
But those who watched him under the responsibility
recently cast upon a Representative of his character
observed that he developed a practical talent which
rendered him useful, not only as champion, but also as
workman in the machine of government. He was a
supporter of the present Administration, and of that
declared policy which, according to the motto of Algernon
Sidney, adopted on the arms of Massachusetts,
seeks “placid quiet under Liberty,”&mdash;<i>placidam sub Libertate
quietem</i>. There are few among his associates who
may not be instructed and inspired by his magnanimous
example.</p>

<p>He had been a lifelong soldier of Liberty, baptized
into a service of blood. While yet young, his brother,
an editor in Illinois, devoted to the slave, fell a victim
to the cause he served so well. His fate awakened
a wide sympathy throughout the country, drawing
Channing from his retirement to speak at Faneuil
Hall, and touching with a living coal the lips of
Wendell Phillips, whose voice then and there, for the
first time, flamed forth against Slavery. It was natural
that Owen Lovejoy should assume those vows of perpetual
warfare with the tyrant murderer which he so
truly kept,&mdash;tyrant murderer of a cherished brother,&mdash;tyrant
murderer of Liberty, not only on the plantation,
but everywhere throughout the land,&mdash;tyrant murderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of the Constitution, which guards alike the rights of
States and citizens,&mdash;and tyrant murderer of national
peace, without which there can be no true prosperity
or happiness. Thus, as a soldier of Liberty, he began,
and he kept his harness on to the last.</p>

<p>He was one of the most amiable of men, whose heart
was abundant with goodness and gentleness, and whose
countenance streamed with sunshine. But on this account
he was only the more inexorable toward a wrong
so cruel in all its influences. A child of the New Testament,
he was no stranger to the early Hebrew spirit,
and had little patience with those who, born among
Northern schools and churches, strove to arrest or mitigate
the doom of Slavery. The famous curse of Meroz,
so solemnly denounced against neutrality, which had
been echoed from ancient Judea by English Puritans
in their great contest, found an echo in his heart:
“Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye
bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not
to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against
the mighty.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Of course, in this spirit he used plain
words, and did not hesitate. But if he did not hesitate,
it was because he saw clearly the path of duty. Amiability
did not make him doubt. He was a positive man,
of positive principles, who knew well how much was always
lost by timid counsels, especially on great occasions.
Because there were some about him who were
skeptical and irresolute, he was not disheartened, but
preserved to the last an example of fidelity which history
will piously enshrine. His own illustrations were
from the sacred writings, but a heathen poet has given
a warning which is part of the lesson of his life:&mdash;</p>

when Maine was part of Massachusetts, which made him
a connecting link between the East and the West. The
welcome he found in the West, and his complete fellowship

to his early home, attest better than arguments the ligatures
binding together these different parts of our common
Union; so that, hereafter, should any malignant

to the whole vast Republic, animating all good citizens

land may be redeemed. Especially does he speak to the
State that honored him in life, and to those associate
States constituting the mighty Northwest, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
found the home of his mature years,&mdash;Indiana, Michigan,

his own, that it may not lose by his death. But, alas!
the vigilance of many will be needed to supply the

<p>Such a character must be mourned in Congress; but
he will be mourned throughout the country, at all those
virtuous firesides where fathers, mothers, brothers, and
sisters speak of those who have helped human happiness
on earth. And there is another company, who
cannot yet pronounce his name, but, as they hear how
truly he was their friend, will rise to call him blessed.
Already, unseen of men, in vast uncounted procession,
the slaves of the Union help to swell his funeral.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 30th, the Senate having under consideration a bill, that had
already passed the House of Representatives, to provide a temporary
government for the Territory of Montana, Mr. Wilkinson, of Minnesota,
moved to amend the clause relating to persons entitled to vote
and eligible to office, so that, instead of “every <em>white male inhabitant</em>,”
it should read “every <em>free male citizen</em> of the United States, and those
who have declared their intention to become such.” Mr. Reverdy Johnson
at once declared that “the effect of the amendment was to admit
to the elective franchise in the proposed Territory black men as well as
white,” and, after mentioning the number of Africans now in the United
States, he proceeded to say that “it can hardly be seriously contended,
that, of that four millions, such portion of them as have been in a state
of slavery from infancy to the present time are intelligent enough, or
likely to become intelligent enough, at once to exercise the right of
suffrage”; and he anticipated another question, “just as likely to excite
the public as the question of the existence of Slavery in itself.”</p>

<p>March 31st, the amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 22, Nays 17. The
debate continuing, Mr. Johnson said that the term “citizen” was not
applicable to “black men,” “because the Supreme Court of the United
States has decided, and that question was directly before the Court
in the Dred Scott case, that a person of African descent is not a citizen
of the United States.” Mr. Wilkinson was willing it should stand
according to his amendment, and let the decision of the Supreme Court
be whatever it might. He wanted neither “white” nor “black” put
into the bill. Mr. Sumner then remarked:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I take it that each branch of the Government can interpret the Constitution
for itself. I think that Congress is as good an authority in its interpretation
as the Supreme Court, and I hope that in legislation it will proceed
absolutely without respect to a decision which has disgraced the country,
and ought to be expelled from its jurisprudence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Johnson vindicated the Dred Scott decision at length, and made
an elaborate eulogy of Chief Justice Taney. In the course of his
remarks, he said: “There are many men, the equals of the honorable
Senator, to say the least, intellectually, who think that that decision
was anything but an outrage.… We have an interest, jurisprudence
has an interest, justice has an interest, the nation has an interest, in
maintaining the character of that tribunal against all unjust reproach.
It is no light thing to pronounce a decision given by such a tribunal as
that as a disgrace.… I cannot, therefore, stand still and hear a tribunal
like that assailed, as I think unnecessarily, by anybody, and particularly
by the honorable member from Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The multiplication table tells
us that two and two make four. Now, if a tribunal
honored like the Supreme Court should undertake
to declare that two and two make five, and a Senator as
distinguished as the Senator from Maryland should uphold
the high tribunal in its decision, I am not satisfied
that it would be presumptuous in me to call that decision
in question. But the Dred Scott decision was as
absurd and irrational as such a reversal of the multiplication
table, besides shocking the moral sense of mankind.
The Senator will pardon the little scruple with
which I denounce it. I claim nothing for myself; I
may be weak; but, according to the measure of my
abilities as God has given them to me, I enter a standing
protest against that atrocious judgment, which was
false in law, and also false in the history with which it
sought to maintain its false law.</p>

<p>The Senator seems to imply that I am not familiar
with the case. Sir, I know it too well. I have read
carefully the opinion of the Chief Justice, which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Senator now vaunts, and I have read, also, the opposing
opinions, by the side of which that much vaunted opinion
is dwarfed into the pettiness proper to a production
in such a cause, ignoble in character, and impotent except
in that little brief authority incident to judicial
rank. The Senator pleads for this judgment in the
name of jurisprudence, of justice, and of the nation.
Sir, by the same title I denounce it,&mdash;in the name of
jurisprudence, which it disgraces, of justice, which it
denies, and of the nation it has offended.</p>

<p>Among the influences and agencies that helped forward
the present Rebellion, and set fellow-citizens in
bloody conflict with each other, the Dred Scott decision
must always be held in dismal memory. It gave conspirators
new confidence. It filled patriots for a while
with despair. It became the platform of Slavery, whose
tyrannical behests would have triumphed, had this decision
been allowed to prevail. Hating the Rebellion in
its origin and all the circumstances that nursed it into
wicked being, we must hate this decision.</p>

<p>But the Senator wandered into eulogy of that old Supreme
Court, now departed, when Marshall was Chief
Justice, and from the past claimed consideration for the
present. Sir, I have been no careless student of that
court in its great and palmy days. I know the learning,
wisdom, and ability of its judgments, and am proud
that there are such pages in the jurisprudence of my
country. My sentiments toward the court of that day
are warmed, also, by personal experience. It is among
the cherished reminiscences of early life, that I was
privileged to know, as a youth might know, the illustrious
magistrate whom the Senator praises so well.
He received me at his table, and allowed me to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
him in his morning walks to the court-room. He
was a venerable character. But I pray the Senator not
to claim for the Dred Scott decision any of the reverence
justly belonging to his name. There is no question
of tribute to Chief Justice Marshall, or respect for the
tribunal while he presided over it. The Dred Scott decision
is more noticed from contrast with all that is good
and great in the decisions of other days. It is sad that
the tribunal that had established such an authority
among us should do an act by which its authority has
been endangered.</p>

<p>This whole debate is in the nature of a diversion or a
deviation, and therefore I bring it back to the precise
point from which it started. The Senator from Maryland
invoked the Dred Scott decision as a reason why
Congress should not recognize colored persons as citizens.
In reply I simply asserted the right of Congress
to interpret the Constitution without constraint from the
Supreme Court, and this I now repeat. Each branch
of the Government must interpret the Constitution for
itself, according to its own sense of obligation under the
oath we have all taken. And God forbid that Congress
should consent to wear the strait-jacket of the Dred
Scott decision!</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson closed his reply by saying: “And without meaning
to offend the honorable member from Massachusetts, and with all
the personal regard which I feel for him, and recollecting the courtesy
that he has extended to me, and which I have reciprocated from
the bottom of my heart, I say to him, without any purpose of offence,
that, if I am obliged to act upon the weight of authority upon all questions
of Constitutional Law, I shall prefer holding to the opinion of
Taney than holding to the opinion of the honorable member.” Mr.
Hale, of New Hampshire, after remarking that he differed from Mr.
Sumner, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> “I do not believe that I think any better of that decision
than he does. I think it was an outrage upon the civilization of
the age and a libel upon the law; but I do not think it was a disgrace
to the Supreme Court of the United States.” [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>The bill passed,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 8.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The House of Representatives disagreed to the Senate amendment,
and a Committee of Conference was ordered, which reported in its favor.
But the House again disagreed, and, April 15th, another Committee
of Conference was appointed, under instructions, moved by Mr. Webster,
of Maryland, “to agree to no report that authorizes any other
than <em>free white male citizens</em>, and those who have declared their intention
to become such, to vote.” The vote of the House on these
instructions stood, Yeas 75, Nays 67. The Senate refused a further
conference upon the terms proposed, which were abandoned by the
House, and a conference without limitation was agreed to. May 19th,
the Conference Committee reported, in lieu of the Senate amendment,
the following clause: “All citizens of the United States, and those who
have declared their intention to become such, and who are otherwise
described and qualified under the fifth section of the Act of Congress
providing for a temporary government for the Territory of Idaho,
approved March 3, 1863.” The reference to the Idaho Act required
explanation, when the following dialogue took place.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I should like to know the nature of the substitute, if the
Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>] will be good enough to state it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I will state in a word that the effect of the amendment of
the Committee of Conference is to authorize the temporary organization of
the Government of Montana by that class of persons that were authorized
to organize the Territory of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> What class of persons was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> They were, as I recollect the qualification, white citizens
of the United States, and such others as had declared their intention to become
citizens. As it now stands, the qualification in Montana will be that
the voters at the first election will be citizens of the United States, and such
as have declared their intention to be citizens of the United States, and such
as are qualified by the fifth section of the Act organizing the Territory of
Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That is, free white persons, I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> That is what it comes to.…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Is not the new proposition almost identical with the original
House proposition on the question of color?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> On the question of the exclusion of colored men it is
identical. It does exclude colored men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understand that the point of difference between the two
Houses was simply as to the word “white” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> “black.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> That was the principal question, and on that point I desire
to say precisely how the Committee found the question.…</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Then the proposition, as I understand it, is, that the Senate
shall abandon its position. Why so? Because the House of Representatives
will not abandon its position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> No, Sir, the Senator will allow me: because there did not
seem to be any practical sense in adhering to it; because to adhere to it
defeated the bill; because to adhere to it accomplished no earthly purpose,
gave nobody any right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> For the other House to adhere on the other side defeated
the bill also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And the question is, Which shall adhere, the side that is
right or the side that is wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> And that is the question the Committee submit to the
Senate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I hope the Senate will adhere to its original position, and
I believe that the assertion of that principle at this moment is more important
than the bill.</p>

</div>

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Harlan said that he should “vote
against the report of the Committee, chiefly, however, because he did
not think there was a pressing necessity for the organization of another
Territory in that part of our domain.” Mr. Sumner called attention to
the Ordinance for the organization of the Northwest Territory, and then
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that in this Ordinance, to which
we so often refer as a commanding authority, there is
no discrimination of color. Now I ask if this is not a
good precedent. Like the present bill, it was applicable
to a vast unsettled Territory. Senators may say that
our fathers, in the Ordinance, were not practical. I am
not of that number. Senators may say that our fathers,
in the Declaration of Independence, were not practical.
I am not of that number. Senators may say that our
fathers, in the Constitution of the United States, which
contains no discrimination of color, were not practical.
I am not of that number. Sir, I believe that the authors
of this Ordinance, and the authors of the Declaration
of Independence, and the authors of the Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
were eminently practical, when they excluded from
those instruments any discrimination of color. But it
is said that there are no persons in the new Territory to
whom the principle is now applicable. This can make
no difference. It is something to declare a principle, and
I cannot hesitate to say that at this moment the principle
is much more important than the bill. The bill
may be postponed, but the principle must not be postponed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I will suggest to the Senator, if he will
permit me,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p class="noindent">&mdash;that the statement I made about its applicability was
this: it is not by possibility applicable to any man of African
descent. There are some five or six thousand Indians, to
whom a bill in general phrase, without limitation of “white,”
might possibly apply; I do not say that it would apply to
them in this case.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Practically, the subject-matter of this
clause is not Indians, but the well-known African race
of this continent; and it is proposed, by specious words
wrapped up in a clause borrowed from another bill, to
exclude them from the right of suffrage in this Territory;
and the argument for this injustice, as my friend
from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>] has so ably stated, is
only a reproduction of that well-known ancient argument
for Slavery in the Territories. How often were
we in those days compelled to encounter the charge that
we were not practical,&mdash;that we were urging a prohibition,
when there was no occasion for it! For myself, I
believe you cannot too often assert a prohibition of Slavery,
nor too often assert human rights, wherever they
may be called in question; and especially do I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in the importance of such assertion when you are laying
the foundations of a new community. “Just as the
twig is bent the tree’s inclined.” These are familiar
words of childhood. Would my friend from Maine have
the tree that he plants grow up with a generous and protecting
shelter for all mankind, or shall it be the bent
and crabbed product of unhappy prejudices which are
only a growth of Slavery? I know my friend means no
such thing; but I insist that the policy he recommends
tends to such fatal end. For myself, Sir, I am satisfied
with the Declaration of Independence; I am satisfied
with the Constitution on this important subject; and,
adopting the language of our Lieutenant-General in the
field, I desire to say, “I will fight on this line to the
end, even if it takes all summer.” There is no line
better than that of human rights. While fighting on
that line, I cannot err; there is no pertinacity too great;
there is no ardor that is not respectable. I thank
General Grant for these words. They express his own
steadfast purpose, and we all thank him. But each, in
his sphere, may make them his own. I make them
mine, wherever human rights are in question.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 14th, the Senate, after debate, ordered three thousand extra
copies of this report,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 19. Mr. Reverdy Johnson,
while urging the extra copies, remarked: “The report is quite an
elaborate one, drawn up with all the fulness which characterizes papers
of this description prepared by the Chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations. He has collected together, very accurately, I have
no doubt, all the facts connected with the claims. He has given the
history of the proceedings in Congress and the proceedings of the Executive,
and has examined very fully all the principles of law applicable
to the questions which the claims present.”</p>

<p>The same report was subsequently adopted by the Committee on
Foreign Relations, and printed by the Senate, March 12, 1867, and
also January 17, 1870.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The Committee on Foreign Relations, to whom were referred
numerous petitions and resolutions of State Legislatures,
taken from the files of the Senate, and also the petition of
sundry citizens of New York, presented at the present session,
asking just compensation for “individual” claims on
France, appropriated by the United States to obtain release
from important “national” obligations, have had the
same under consideration, and beg leave to report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The welfare of the Republic requires that there
should he an end of “suits,” lest, while men are
mortal, these should be immortal. Such is a venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
maxim of the law, illustrated by the case before the
Committee. The present claims have outlived all the
original sufferers, and at least two generations of those
who have so ably enforced them in the Halls of Congress.
Against their unwonted vitality death has not
been able to prevail.</p>


<h3>CHARACTER OF THESE CLAIMS.</h3>

<p>Of all claims in our history, these are most associated
with great events and great sacrifices. First in time,
they are also first in character, for they spring from the
very cradle of the Republic and the trials of its infancy.
To comprehend them, you must know, first, how independence
was won, and, secondly, how, at a later day,
peace was assured. Other claims have been personal or
litigious; these are historic. Here were “individual”
losses, felt at the time most keenly, and constituting an
unanswerable claim upon France, which, at a critical
moment, were employed by our Government, like a
credit or cash in hand, to purchase release from outstanding
“national” obligations, so that the whole country
became at once trustee of these sufferers, bound,
of course, to gratitude for the means thus contributed,
but bound also to indemnify them against these losses.
And yet these sufferers, thus unique in situation, have
been compelled to see all other claims for foreign spoliations
satisfied, while they alone have been turned away.
At the beginning of our history, our plundered fellow-citizens
obtained compensation to the amount of many
million dollars on account of British spoliations. Similar
indemnities have been obtained since from Spain,
Naples, Denmark, Mexico, and the South American states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
while, by the famous Convention of 1831, France contributed
five million dollars to the satisfaction of spoliations
under the Continental system of Napoleon. Spain stipulated
to pay for every ship or cargo taken within Spanish
waters, even by the French; so that French spoliations
on our commerce within Spanish waters have been paid
for, but French spoliations on our commerce elsewhere
before 1800 are still unredeemed. Such has been the
fortune of claimants the most meritorious of all.</p>

<p>In all other cases there has been simply a claim for
foreign spoliations, but without superadded obligation
on the part of our Government. Here is a claim for
foreign spoliations, the precise counterpart of all other
claims, but with superadded obligation, on the part
of our Government, in the nature of a debt, constituting
an <i>assumpsit</i>, or implied promise to pay; so
that these sufferers are not merely <em>claimants</em> on account
of French spoliations, but they are also <em>creditors</em>
on account of a plain assumption by the National Government
of the undoubted liability of France. The appeal
of these <em>creditor claimants</em> is enhanced beyond the
pecuniary interests involved, when we consider the nature
of this assumption, and especially that in this way
our country obtained final release from embarrassing
stipulations with France contracted in the war for national
independence. Regarding it, therefore, as <em>debt</em>,
it constitutes part of that sacred debt incurred for national
independence, and is the only part now outstanding
and unpaid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>


<h3>PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to consider the nature of existing
obligations on the part of the United States, the Committee
ask attention to three objections which they
encounter on the threshold: the first, founded on the
alleged antiquity of the original claims; the second, on
the alleged character of the actual possessors; and the
third, on the present condition of the country.</p>


<h4>I.&mdash;CLAIMS ANCIENT, BUT NOT STALE.</h4>

<p>It is said that the claims are ancient and stale,
and therefore not to be entertained. It is true that the
claims are the most ancient of any now pending, and
that they date from the very origin of our existence as
a nation. But in this respect they do not differ from a
Revolutionary pension or a Revolutionary claim. Down
to this day there is a standing committee of the Senate,
entitled “Committee on Revolutionary Claims”; but if
a claim traced to the Revolution must be rejected for
staleness, there can be little use for this committee. If
these claims, after uninterrupted sleep throughout the
long intervening period, were now for the first time
revived, they might be obnoxious to this imputation.
But, as from the beginning of the century they have
occupied the attention of Congress, and been sustained
by speeches, reports, and votes, it is impossible to say
that they have been allowed to sleep.</p>

<p>The whole case was stated with admirable succinctness,
as long ago as 1807, by Mr. Marion, of South Carolina,
in the report of a committee of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From a mature consideration of the subject, and from
the best judgment your Committee have been able to form
on the case, <em>they are of opinion that this Government</em>, by expunging
the second article of our Convention with France of
the 30th September, 1800, <em>became bound to indemnify the
memorialists for those just claims</em> which they otherwise would
rightfully have had on the Government of France, for the
spoliations committed on their commerce by the illegal captures
made by the cruisers and other armed vessels of that
power, in violation of the Law of Nations, and in breach of
treaties then existing between the two nations; which claims
they were, by the rejection of the said article of the Convention,
forever barred from preferring to the Government of
France for compensation.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Claims thus authoritatively stated at that early day
cannot be overcome by any sleep.</p>

<p>It is true that these claims were pressed with less
constancy and determination at the beginning of the
century than at a later day. But there are two sufficient
reasons for the change. First, the evidence on
which they are founded was less generally known at
the beginning than afterward. It was only in 1826,
under the administration of John Quincy Adams, by
the communication to Congress of the ample materials
accumulated in the Archives of State, that the true
strength of the case was fully revealed. Here, in one
full volume, was the documentary history of the whole
double transaction,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> showing at once the original obligation
of France, and the substituted obligation of the
United States, reinforced by the associations of our
own Revolutionary history. A more sufficient reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for this change is found in the fact, that for some time
in the early part of the century our country was still
laboring under pressure of the Revolutionary debt. As
this pressure was gradually removed, and the national
resources became more apparent, these claims were naturally
urged with more confidence, until, on the final
extinction of that debt, they occupied the attention of
the best minds in both Houses of Congress.</p>

<p>No single question in our history has been the subject
of such a succession of able reports. Whether counted
or weighed, these reports are equally exceptional. They
are no less than forty-one in number, twenty-two in
the Senate and nineteen in the House. Among the
eminent characters whose names they bear are Edward
Livingston, John Holmes, Edward Everett, Daniel Webster,
Caleb Gushing, Charles J. Ingersoll, John M. Clayton,
and Rufus Choate. Out of the whole number only
three have been adverse,&mdash;one in the Senate and two
in the House. But the three adverse reports were evasive
only, besides being prior to the communication of
the decisive evidence on the subject. The thirty-six
reports since that communication were all in favor of
the claims.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Resolutions in favor of these claims by thirteen States,
being the original number which declared independence,
have been presented to Congress between the years 1832
and 1858. Some States, not content with one series,
have repeated their resolutions, and accompanied them
with elaborate arguments. They all tend to the conclusion
that it is the duty of Congress, without further
delay, to provide for these claims; and Senators and
Representatives are earnestly requested to use their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
best exertions for an Act of Congress to carry this obligation
into effect.</p>

<p>Memorials and petitions from the beginning testify to
the sleeplessness of these claims. On the 5th of February,
1802, only forty-six days after the promulgation of
the Convention of 1800, they began, and they have continued
from that early day down to this very session of
Congress, making in all four thousand six hundred and
two. Of these, nineteen hundred and thirty-one were
in the Senate, two thousand six hundred and seventy-one
in the House. They are chiefly from original sufferers,
their executors, administrators, assigns, widows, and
heirs, residing in the large seaports from which the despoiled
vessels originally sailed; but there are some from
all parts of the country, where, in the vicissitudes of life,
the representatives of original sufferers have been carried,&mdash;all
of which may be seen in the list of these
petitioners.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Two several times&mdash;once under President Polk, and
again under President Pierce&mdash;both Houses of Congress
concurred in an act for the relief of these claimants; but
this tardy justice was arrested by Presidential veto.</p>

<p>In the face of this constant succession of reports, resolutions
of State Legislatures, and petitions, constituting
not only “continual claim,” but continual recognition of
the claim,&mdash;the whole crowned by two several Acts of
Congress,&mdash;it is impossible to infer negligence in the
claimants, or, indeed, any assumption of inordinate confidence.
They have had good reason to believe that they
should be successful. Under such circumstances, the
lapse of time, sometimes urged against them, becomes
an argument in their favor; for it adds constantly recurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
testimony to their merits, besides a new title
from the disappointment to which they have been
doomed. Claims beginning thus early, and thus sustained,
may be ancient, but they cannot be stale.</p>


<h4>II.&mdash;POSSESSORS OF THE CLAIMS ARE NOT SPECULATORS.</h4>

<p>A trivial remark, which is rather slur than objection,
may justify a moment’s attention. It is sometimes
said that these claims are no longer the property
of the original sufferers or their representatives, but that
they have passed, like a fancy stock, into the hands of
speculators. This remark, if it had foundation in fact,
has little in equity. It would be hardly creditable for
a government to take advantage of its own procrastination,
and refuse just compensation, because the original
sufferer had been compelled by unwelcome necessity to
discount his claims.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, such claims, being unliquidated,
do not readily pass from hand to hand, but
remain in the original custody, as has become apparent
in ample experience. Precisely the same reflection was
cast upon the claims against Spain, Denmark, and Naples,&mdash;and,
indeed, it is cast upon long outstanding claims
generally, until it has become a commonplace of sarcasm.
The records of successive Commissions which have liquidated
foreign claims afford its best refutation. In every
case these Commissions required proof of property; but
the evidence disclosed that the original sufferers, or their
legal representatives, including heirs, executors, assignees
of bankrupts, persons having a lien for advances, or underwriters,
possessing in law and equity the same right
as the original sufferers, were actual possessors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
larger part. There is no reason to suppose that it would
be otherwise with the claims for French spoliations. On
the contrary, it is believed that they remain substantially
unchanged, except by legal inheritance.</p>

<p>The great speculator has been Death; for there are few
of these claims that have not passed through his hands.
Such a transfer cannot draw the title into doubt, especially
when we consider the character of the petitioners
whose names are spread on the journals of Congress.
It is well known that in many families these claims still
exist as heirlooms, transmitted by ancestral care in full
confidence that sooner or later they will be recognized
by the Government.</p>


<h4>III.&mdash;PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY NO REASON
AGAINST PAYMENT OF JUST DEBTS.</h4>

<p>It is sometimes suggested, that, even assuming the
meritorious character of these claims, yet, in the present
condition of the country, they ought to be postponed.
Looking at the practical consequences of this suggestion,
it will be found, that, though plausible in <em>form</em>, it is
fatal in <em>substance</em>. Any postponement must inevitably
throw these claims into direct competition with those
now accumulating on account of losses during the Rebellion,
having in their favor the swelling sympathies
of our time. It is not unjust to human nature, if the
Committee say that the distant in time, like the distant
in space, is too often out of mind. If the earlier
claims are just, they should not be exposed to the
hazards of any such competition, when feeling will be
stronger than reason. From the probability of future
claims, whose shadows already commence, the argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
is strengthened for the immediate satisfaction of those
now existing, especially when we consider their character
and origin.</p>

<p>The resources of the people are tasked to put down
the Rebellion which Slavery has aroused. Let nothing
be stinted. But there is another duty not to be forgotten.
<em>The just debts of the Republic must be paid</em>, to the
last dollar. Here, also, nothing must be stinted; and
the glory of the one will be kindred to the glory of the
other. The Republic will have new title to love at
home and to honor abroad, when with one hand it overcomes
the Rebellion now menacing its existence, and
with the other does justice to ancient petitioners, long
neglected, constituting the only remaining creditors left
to us from the War of Independence.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION.</h3>

<p>Therefore, putting aside all preliminary objections
from alleged antiquity, from the character of the actual
possessors, or from the present condition of the country,
the Committee insist that the present obligations of the
United States must be determined according to principles
of justice and the facts of the case. The hearing
now is as if there had been no lapse of time since the
obligations accrued, and as if no war now existed to task
the country.</p>

<p>Is the money justly due? To answer this question,
the subject must be considered in detail, under several
heads.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Claims of citizens of the United States against
France, founded on spoliations of our commerce, as seen
in their origin and history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> Counter claims of France, founded on
treaty stipulations and services rendered in the War
of Independence, also as seen in their origin and history.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The Convention of 1800 and the reciprocal
release of the two Governments, by which the “individual”
claims of the petitioners were treated as a set-off
to the “national” claims of France.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> The assumption by our Government of the
obligations of France, so that the United States were
substituted for France, and became liable to these petitioners
as France had been liable.</p>

<p>After considering these heads in their order, it will
be proper to review the objections alleged against the
liability of the United States: (1.) from the semi-hostile
relations between France and the United States anterior
to the Convention; (2.) from payments under the Louisiana
Treaty; (3.) from payments under the Convention
with France in 1831; (4.) from the Act of Congress annulling
the early treaties with France; (5.) from the
early efforts of our Government to obtain from France
the satisfaction of these claims; and (6.) from the desperate
character attributed to these claims at the time
of their abandonment.</p>

<p>The question of “just compensation” will present itself
last: (1.) in the advantages secured to the United
States by the sacrifice of these claims; (2.) in the value
of the losses which the claimants suffered; and (3.) in
the recommendation of the Committee.</p>

<p>The subject is of such importance, from the magnitude
of interests involved, and from its historic character,
that the minuteness of this inquiry will not be
regarded as superfluous.</p>

<h4>I.<br />

CLAIMS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THEIR ORIGIN AND
HISTORY.</h4>

<p>The history of French spoliations on our commerce is
a gloomy chapter, where a friendly power, assuming the
name of Republic, shows itself fitful, passionate, and unjust.
This conduct is more remarkable, when it is considered,
that, only a short time before, France, while yet
a kingdom, contributed treasure and blood to sustain
our national independence. And yet an explanation
may be found in the extraordinary temper of the times.
By a generous uprising of the people the kingdom was
overthrown, and then, as the alarmed royalties of Europe
intervened, the head of the monarch was flung to
them as a gage of battle. The gage had been accepted
in advance, and all those royalties, by successive treaties,
entered into coalition against France. The fleets of
England came tardily into the great contest, but their
presence gave to it a new character, and enveloped
ocean as well as land in its flames. The growing commerce
of the United States suffered from both sides,
but especially from France, driven to frenzy by the
British attempt, in the exercise of belligerent rights,
to starve a whole nation.</p>

<p>French feelings were still further aroused against the
United States, when, instead of friendship and alliance,
France was encountered by the Proclamation of Neutrality
launched by Washington on the 22d April, 1793,
where he undertook, in behalf of the United States, to
“adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial
toward the belligerent powers.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Here, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
France, was a failure not only of that proper sympathy
due from us, but even of solemn duties pledged by those
early treaties which helped to secure the national independence.
This failure, which became afterward the
occasion of counter claims, contributed to the exasperations
of the time.</p>

<p>An early apology, addressed to the American minister
at Paris by the French Government, attests the spoliations
which had begun, and discloses also their indefensible
character, unless the common language spoken
by the English and ourselves was a sufficient excuse.
Here are the exact words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We hope that the Government of the United States will
attribute to their true cause the abuses of which you complain,
as well as other violations of which our cruisers may
render themselves guilty in the course of the present war.
<em>It must perceive how difficult it is to contain within just limits
the indignation of our marines, and, in general, of all the
French patriots, against a people who speak the same language
and having the same habits as the free Americans.</em> The difficulty
of distinguishing our allies from our enemies has often
been the cause of offences committed on board your vessels;
all that the Administration could do is to order indemnification
to those who have suffered, and to punish the guilty.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus recklessly did these spoliations begin. The
National Convention associated itself with this injustice,
when, on the 9th May, 1793, only seventeen days after
the Proclamation of Neutrality, but before it had arrived
in France, a retaliatory decree was issued in response to
the British attempt at starvation,&mdash;arresting all neutral
vessels laden with provisions and destined to an enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
port. The decree itself did not disguise that it was a
violation of neutral rights; but the necessity of the hour
was pleaded, <em>and indemnity was promised to neutrals
suffering by its operation</em>.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Unwilling to await the dilatory
performance of this promise, our minister at Paris
remonstrated against the application of the decree to
vessels of the United States. Amidst vacillations of
the National Convention, which, under the urgency of
our minister, at one time seemed to relent, the decree
continued to be enforced against property of American
citizens. Here were spoliations, confessed at the time
to be in violation of neutral rights, which still rise in
judgment.</p>

<p>As this intelligence reached the United States, our
whole commerce was fluttered. Merchants hesitated to
expose ships and cargoes to such cruel hazards. It was
necessary that something should be done to enlist again
their activity. The National Government <em>came forward
voluntarily</em>, with assurance of protection and redress,
in a circular letter, dated 27th August, 1793,
when Mr. Jefferson, the Secretary of State, in the name
of the President, used the following language: “I have
it in charge from the President to assure the merchants
of the United States concerned in foreign commerce or
navigation, that due attention will be paid to any injuries
they may suffer on the high seas or in foreign
countries, contrary to the Law of Nations or to existing
treaties, and that, on their forwarding hither well-authenticated
evidence of the same, <em>proper proceedings
will be adopted for their relief</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This circular was
confirmed by President Washington, in his message of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
December 5, 1793, where he speaks as follows: “The
<em>vexations and spoliation</em> understood to have been committed
on our vessels and commerce by the cruisers
and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared
to require attention. The proofs of these, however, not
having been brought forward, the description of citizens
supposed to have suffered were notified, that, on furnishing
them to the Executive, <em>due measures would be taken
to obtain redress of the past</em> and more effectual provisions
against the future.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Here, then, was a double
promise from the National Government, and under its
encouragement our merchants resumed their commerce,
venturing once more upon the ocean. Their Government
had tempted them, and, on the occurrence of
“injuries on the high seas,” these good citizens, according
to instructions, made haste to lodge with the Department
of State the “well-authenticated evidence of
the same.” Their children and grandchildren are waiting,
even now, the promised redress.</p>

<p>Thus, at the very beginning, these spoliations were
recognized by both Governments in their true character.
The National Convention, even in its arbitrary edict, confessed
them. The Administration of Washington, in
its solemn assurance of protection, also confessed them.
Offspring of wrongful violence in the heat of war, they
were regarded on both sides as indefensible. Ministers,
in this respect, reflected the sentiments of the two Governments.
Fauchet, the French minister at Philadelphia,
in a communication to the Secretary of State, under
date of March 27, 1794, expressed himself in this
manner:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> “If any of your merchants have suffered any
injury by the conduct of our privateers, (a thing which
would be contrary to the intention and express orders
of the Republic,) they may with confidence address
themselves to the French Government, which will never
refuse justice to those whose claims shall be legal.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Mr. Morris, our minister at Paris, under date of March
6, 1794, gave vent to his feelings: “These captures
create great confusion, <em>must produce much damage to
mercantile men</em>, and are a source of endless and well-founded
complaint. Every post brings me piles of letters
about it from all quarters, and I see no remedy.…
In the mean time, if I would give way to the clamors
of the injured parties, I ought to make demands very
like a declaration of war.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But M. Buchot, the French
Commissioner of Foreign Relations, addressed Mr. Morris
the following soothing words, under date of July 5,
1794: “The sentiments of the Convention and of the
Government towards your fellow-citizens are too well
known to you to leave a doubt of <em>their dispositions to
make good the losses which the circumstances inseparable
from a great revolution may have caused some American
navigators to experience</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Such was the testimony, at
that day, of ministers on both sides.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Genet, the French minister, was recalled,
at the instance of President Washington, on account
of presumptuous interference in our affairs, especially
hostile to the Proclamation of Neutrality; and John
Jay reached London to negotiate the treaty of 1794
which goes under his name. The latter event added
to the exasperation of France. But Mr. Monroe, who
took the place of Mr. Morris at Paris, was full of
sympathy for the new republic, even when he frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
discharged his unpleasant duties. In a communication
to the Committee of Public Safety, under date of October
18, 1794, he exposed “a frightful picture of difficulties
and losses, equally injurious to both countries,
and which, if suffered to continue, will unavoidably
interrupt for the time the commercial intercourse between
them.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Notwithstanding this strong language,
his influence was thought to have prevailed so far
that President Washington ventured to announce, in a
confidential message of February 28, 1795, good news
for our plundered merchants. “It affords me,” he said,
“the highest pleasure to inform Congress that perfect
harmony reigns between the two republics, <em>and that
those claims are in a train of being discussed with candor,
and of being amicably adjusted</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This perfect
harmony was short-lived, and the hopes flowering from
it were nipped.</p>

<p>The rumor of Mr. Jay’s negotiations with England
had already produced uneasiness in France; but when
the treaty, on its ratification, in October, 1795, was
finally divulged, there was an outburst against us. The
treaty was pronounced to be in violation of existing
engagements with France, and our whole policy was
openly branded by the President of the Directory, in
reply to Mr. Monroe, as a “condescension of the American
Government to the wishes of its ancient tyrants.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
The Directory refused to receive Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney, sent by our Government in place of James
Monroe. Meanwhile, by a succession of cruel edicts, it
unleashed all its cruisers to despoil our commerce, and
cry havoc wherever they sailed. On the 2d July, 1796,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
it was declared that “the French Republic will treat neutral
vessels, either as to confiscation, as to searches, or
capture, <em>in the same manner as they shall suffer the English
to treat them</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The indefinite terms of this edict
were justly denounced by our Government, as “giving
scope for arbitrary constructions, and consequently for
unlimited oppression and vexation.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> These results were
soon manifest. With contagious injustice, the French
commissioners at San Domingo reported to the Government
at home, “that, having found no resource in
finance, and knowing the unfriendly disposition of the
Americans, and to avoid perishing in distress, they had
armed for cruising, and that already eighty-seven cruisers
were at sea, and that for three months preceding the
Administration had subsisted and individuals been enriched
with the products of those prizes.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> So extensively
did this brutality prevail, that it was announced
that American vessels “no longer entered the French
ports, <em>unless carried in by force</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>This spirit of hostility broke forth in another edict of
the Directory, which became at once a universal scourge
to American commerce. This fulmination, bearing date
March 2, 1797, after enlarging the list of contraband,
and ordaining other measures of rigor, proceeds to declare
all American vessels lawful prize, if found without
a <i>rôle d’équipage</i>, or <em>circumstantial list</em> of the crew:<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
all of which was in violation of existing treaties, and
also of American usage, which notoriously did not require,
among a ship’s papers, any such list. No edict
was so comprehensive in its sweep; for, as all our vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were without this safeguard, they were all defenceless.
Numberless spoliations ensued, so absolutely lawless and
unjust that John Marshall did not hesitate to record of
them in his journal, under date of December 17, 1797,
“The claims of the American citizens for property captured
and condemned for want of a <i>rôle d’équipage</i>”
constituted “<em>as complete a right as any individuals ever
possessed</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This right, thus complete, according to the
judgment of our great authority, enters into a large
part of the claims still pending before Congress.</p>

<p>As if to perfect this strange, eventful history, a third
edict, at once inhospitable and unjust, was launched
by the Directory, January 18, 1798, prohibiting “every
foreign vessel which in the course of her voyage shall
have entered into an English port from being admitted
into a port of the French Republic, except in case of
necessity,” and, still further, handing over to condemnation
“every vessel found at sea loaded in whole or
in part with merchandise the production of England
or of her possessions.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> This edict was promptly denounced
by the American plenipotentiaries newly arrived
at Paris. In earnest, vigorous tones, they said that
it invaded at the same time the interests and the independence
of neutral powers,&mdash;<em>that it took from them the
profits of an honest and lawful industry</em>, as well as the
inestimable privilege of conducting their own affairs as
their own judgment might direct,&mdash;and that acquiescence
in it would establish a precedent for national degradation,
authorizing any measures power might be disposed
to practise.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Our plenipotentiaries depicted the
spirit in which French spoliations had their origin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the humiliating consequences of submission to the outrage;
but the personal sufferers are, down to this day,
without redress.</p>

<p>Perplexed and indignant, the United States constituted
a special mission of three eminent citizens, Mr.
Pinckney, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Gerry, who were
charged to secure indemnity for these spoliations. In
his elaborate instructions, dated July 15, 1797, the Secretary
of State, Mr. Pickering, lays down the following
rule of conduct: “In respect to the depredations on our
commerce, the principal objects will be to agree on an
equitable mode of examining and deciding the claims
of our citizens, and the manner and periods of making
them compensation.… The proposed mode of
adjusting those claims, by commissioners appointed on
each side, is so perfectly fair, we cannot imagine that
it will be refused.” Although this reparation was not
made “an indispensable condition of the proposed
treaty,” yet the plenipotentiaries were enjoined “not
to renounce these claims of our citizens, <em>nor to stipulate
that they be assumed by the United States as a loan
to the French Government</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Thus fully were these
claims recognized at the time by our Government, and
most carefully placed under the protection of our plenipotentiary
triumvirate.</p>

<p>The triumvirate found the French Republic in no
mood of justice. Bonaparte was then triumphant at
the head of the army of Italy, and Talleyrand was
exhibiting his remarkable powers at the head of the
foreign relations of France. Victory had given confidence,
and the exulting Republic was standing tiptoe,
more disposed to strike than negotiate, unless it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
could dictate, and implacable always towards England
and all supposed to sympathize with that power. After
exactions and humiliations hard to bear, the plenipotentiaries
were compelled to return home without any official
reception by the intoxicated Government to which
they were accredited, but not before they had encountered
the masterly ability of Talleyrand, who, in reply
to their statement of the claims of the United States,
presented the counter claims of France. Though in
Paris merely on sufferance, they had unofficial interviews
with various agents of the Republic, and even
with Talleyrand himself; but without dwelling on details
not pertinent to the occasion, it is enough to say,
that, while refusing to offer a loan or bribe, they were
able to declare frankly “that France had taken violently
from America more than fifteen millions of dollars, and
treated us in every respect as enemies”;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and also to
receive from Talleyrand a concession, recorded in one of
their despatches, that “some of those claims were probably
just,” with the inquiry, “whether, if they were
acknowledged by France, we could not give a credit as
to the payment,&mdash;say, for two years?”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Here again
was an admission not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The return of our disappointed plenipotentiaries was
aggravated by circumstances which an eminent Continental
writer has not hesitated to brand as “unique in
the annals of diplomacy.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> They had been invited to
contribute a <em>gratification</em> of twelve hundred thousand
francs, and the whole desperate intrigue, conducted by
persons known in the correspondence as W, X, Y, Z, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
unveiled to the world. The country was indignant, and
war seemed imminent. By various acts of legislation
Congress entered upon preparations, summoning Washington
from retirement to gird on his sword once more
as Lieutenant-General. The claims for French spoliations
were never absent from mind. By Act of the 28th May,
1798, public vessels of the United States were authorized
to capture all “armed vessels sailing under authority
or pretence of authority from the Republic of
France,” “<em>which shall have committed</em>, or which shall be
found hovering on the coasts of the United States for
the purpose of committing, <em>depredations on the vessels
belonging to citizens thereof</em>”; and this statute was introduced
by a preamble asserting “<em>depredations on the
commerce of the United States</em>, … in violation of the
Law of Nations and treaties between the United States
and the French nation.” By Act of June 13, 1798, all
commercial intercourse was suspended between the United
States and France, until “the Government of France … shall
clearly disavow, and shall be found to refrain
from, <em>the aggressions, depredations, and hostilities which
have been and are by them encouraged and maintained
against the vessels and other property of the citizens of
the United States</em>.” By Act of June 25, 1798, merchant
vessels of the United States were authorized to resist
search or seizure by any French armed vessel, to repel
assaults, and to capture the aggressors, until “the Government
of France … shall disavow, and shall cause
the commanders and crews of all armed French vessels
<em>to refrain from, the lawless depredations and outrages
hitherto encouraged and authorized by that Government
against the merchant vessels of the United States</em>.” By
Act of July 7, 1798, the treaties with France were declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to be no longer obligatory on the United States;
and this statute was introduced by a preamble asserting
that “<em>the just claims of the United States for reparation
of injuries</em> have been refused, and their attempts
to negotiate an amicable adjustment of all complaints
between the two nations have been repelled with indignity.”
Thus, by express words, in repeated acts,
did Congress recognize these claims.</p>

<p>By such vigorous measures were the rights of these
claimants asserted, while the country assumed an attitude
of defence. The French Directory became less
intolerable, and negotiations were invited again, with
assurance that the former rudeness should not be renewed.
John Adams was President, and for the sake
of peace he seized the opportunity of this overture, by
appointing Chief Justice Ellsworth, Patrick Henry, and
William Vans Murray as a second plenipotentiary triumvirate
to France. As Mr. Henry declined, Mr. Davie,
of North Carolina, was substituted in his place. In adjusting
the instructions President Adams himself took
a personal part, as appears by a letter to the Secretary
of State, where he says: “The principal points, <em>indeed
all the points</em>, of the negotiation were so minutely
considered and <em>approved by me and all the heads of department</em>
that nothing remains but to put them into
form and dress: this service I pray you to perform
as promptly as possible.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> But “all the points” were
three only: 1st, Indemnity for spoliations of American
commerce; 2d, The unquestionable wrong of seizing
American vessels for want of the paper known to
French law as <i>rôle d’équipage</i>; 3d, The refusal to renew
the treaty guaranty of the French West Indies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Such were the <i>ultimata</i> originally settled by the President
and his cabinet on the 11th of March, 1799, and
afterwards fully developed in the elaborate instructions
of Mr. Pickering, dated 22d October, 1799, which, after
announcing that “the conduct of the French Republic
would well have justified an immediate declaration of
war on the part of the United States,” proceeded to
declare, as the first point, that the plenipotentiaries,
“<em>at the opening of the negotiation</em>, will inform the
French ministers that the United States expect from
France, <em>as an indispensable condition of the treaty</em>, a
stipulation to make to the citizens of the United States
<em>full compensation for all losses and damages</em> which they
shall have sustained by reason of irregular or illegal
captures or condemnations of their vessels and other
property.” And the instructions end, as they began,
by declaring, first among the terms, “that an article
be inserted for establishing a board with suitable powers
to hear and determine the claims of our citizens,
<em>and binding France to pay or secure payment of the sums
which shall be awarded</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Observe the positiveness of
the assertion.</p>

<p>These instructions attest the interest of our Government.
Placed first among the <i>ultimata</i> adopted in the
councils of President Adams, these indemnities were
placed first in the diplomatic instructions. There is
yet other evidence of the character and amount of the
spoliations. The Secretary of State, in a report to Congress,
dated January 18, 1799, after attributing them
to French feeling on account of the British treaty, proceeds
to characterize them in remarkable words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> “Yet
that treaty had been made by the French Government
its chief pretence for those unjust and cruel depredations
on American commerce which have brought distress on
multitudes and ruin on many of our citizens, and occasioned
<em>a total loss of property to the United States of probably
more than twenty millions of dollars</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Such were
the outrages for which our plenipotentiaries were to seek
redress.</p>

<p>The Directory had ceased; but on reaching Paris the
plenipotentiaries were cordially received by Talleyrand,
the citizen minister of Foreign Affairs, who without
delay presented them to the First Consul as he was
about to mount for that wonderful campaign which,
opening with the passage of the Alps, closed at Marengo.
Negotiations commenced at once, Joseph Bonaparte,
elder brother of the First Consul, and afterward
King of Spain, being at the head of the commission on
the part of France. “Appreciating,” as they announced,
“the value of time,” the American plenipotentiaries, in a
brief note, on the 7th of April,&mdash;the very day when the
exchange of powers was completed,&mdash;proposed “an arrangement
<em>to ascertain and discharge the equitable claims
of the citizens</em> of either nation upon the other, whether
founded on contract, treaty, or the Law of Nations”;
all of which was to be done in order “to satisfy the
demands of justice, and render a reconciliation cordial
and permanent.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Thus instantly were these claims presented.
The French plenipotentiaries in their prompt
reply admitted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> “<em>the first object</em> of the negotiation
ought to be the determination of the regulations, and
the steps to be followed, for <em>the estimation and indemnification
of injuries for which either nation may make
claim for itself</em> or for any of its citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Here was
the suggestion of claims, not only “individual,” but also
“national,” under which loomed the counter claims of
France.</p>

<p>The American plenipotentiaries, while professing to
be free from “apprehension of an unfavorable <em>balance</em>,”
protested against the consideration of any “national”
claims until some “convenient stage of the negotiation,
after it shall be seen what arrangement would be acceptable
for <em>the claims of citizens</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The French plenipotentiaries
rejoined by enforcing “national” as well
as “individual” claims.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The issue seemed to be made.
On the one side were the “individual” claims of American
citizens, on the other side the “national” claims of
France. The American plenipotentiaries were not authorized
to recognize the “national” claims alone. The
French plenipotentiaries were not authorized to recognize
the “individual” claims, without a previous recognition
on our part of the “national” claims. At last, after various
efforts at harmony, it was officially announced that
“the negotiation was at a stand on the part of France,”
as her plenipotentiaries were constrained by instructions
of the First Consul to make “the acknowledgment of
former treaties the basis of negotiation <em>and the condition
of compensation</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The First Consul was then on the
Italian slope of the Alps, about to pounce upon the astonished
Austrians. Claims and counter claims were of
little concern to him.</p>

<p>Thus far the Committee have exhibited our claims in
their origin and history. The time has come to change
the scene, and to exhibit those counter claims which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
played such part in the successive negotiations, and
finally produced that memorable <em>dead-lock</em>, when the
two powers stood face to face with antagonist pretensions,
unable to go forward, and unwilling to go backward.</p>


<h4>II.<br />
COUNTER CLAIMS OF FRANCE, THEIR ORIGIN AND
HISTORY.</h4>

<p>The counter claims of France differ widely from the
claims of American citizens. They were not “individual,”
but “national,” being founded on alleged violations
of treaty stipulations assumed by the United States in
return for the aid of France in the establishment of national
independence. During the protracted controversy
between the two republics they were detailed in numerous
official notes; but they were brandished by Talleyrand,
with offensive skill and effect, in the very faces of
our insulted plenipotentiaries, under date of March 18,
1798, when, while driving them from Paris, he insisted
“<em>that the priority of grievances and complaints belonged
to the French Republic</em>,” and “that these complaints and
these grievances were as real as numerous, long before the
United States had the least grounded claim to make.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Careful inquiry enables us to see that this allegation, thus
confidently uttered, was not without a certain foundation;
and here we revert to the history of our country.</p>

<p>The triumph with which the War of Independence
happily ended came tardily, after seven years of battle,
suffering, and exhaustion; but it was hastened, if not assured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
by the generous alliance of France. From Bunker
Hill to Saratoga the war was checkered with gloom,
which even the surrender of Burgoyne did not suffice to
dispel. Then came the dreary winter of Valley Forge,
when soldiers of Washington, after treading the snows
barefoot, were obliged, for want of blankets, to huddle
all night by the fires, and even the stout heart of the
commander-in-chief bent so far as to announce, in formal
letter to Congress, that, “unless some great and
capital change suddenly takes place, the army must inevitably
be reduced to one or other of these three things,&mdash;starve,
dissolve, or disperse.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> But the scene changed
with the glad tidings that France, by solemn treaty,
signed by Franklin, February 6, 1778, had bound herself
to “guaranty to the United States their liberty, sovereignty,
and independence, absolute and unlimited.” The
camp broke forth with the mingled joy of soldier and
patriot, as it turned gratefully to Lafayette, already by
the side of Washington, glorious forerunner of armies
and navies promised to our cause. Congress took up
the strain, and, by unanimous vote, ratified the treaty
which opened to our country the gates of the Future.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the value of this treaty in
money, especially when we consider its consequences.
According to the report of Calonne, the French Minister
of Finance, the war which ensued in the support of this
guaranty cost France fourteen hundred and forty millions
of francs, or about two hundred and eighty millions
of dollars. But French blood, more costly than
money, was shed on land and sea in the same cause, until
at last the army of Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to the allied forces of Rochambeau and Washington,
and the war closed by the recognition of our national
independence. If liberty be priceless, if life be
priceless, then was the aid lavished by France infinite
beyond calculation.</p>

<p>The engagements were not all on the side of France.
Beyond gratitude due for this powerful alliance, were
express obligations solemnly assumed by the United
States, not only in the Treaty of Alliance, but also in
the Treaty of Amity and Commerce negotiated on the
same day. These obligations, constituting the consideration
of the weighty contract, were of two classes: first,
a guaranty by the United States of the possessions of
France in America; and, secondly, important privileges
for the armed ships of France, with a promise of American
convoy to French commerce.</p>

<p>1. The terms of the guaranty are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The two parties guaranty, <em>mutually</em>, from the present
time <em>and forever</em>, against all other powers, to wit: The
United States to His Most Christian Majesty, <em>the present
possessions of the crown of France in America</em>, as well as those
which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace; and
His Most Christian Majesty guaranties, on his part, to the
United States, <em>their liberty</em>, <em>sovereignty</em>, <em>and independence, absolute
and unlimited</em>, as well in matters of government as
commerce, and also their possessions, and the additions or
conquests that their Confederation may obtain during the
war from any of the dominions now or heretofore possessed
by Great Britain in North America.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To fix more precisely the sense of this article, it was
further stipulated, that,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>In case of a rupture</em> between France and England, the
reciprocal guaranty shall have its full force and effect the
moment such war shall break out; and if such rupture shall
not take place, the mutual obligations of the said guaranty
shall not commence until the moment of the cessation of the
present war between the United States and England shall
have ascertained their possessions.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The possessions of France in America at this date
were the islands of San Domingo, Martinique, Guadeloupe,
St. Lucia, St. Bartholomew, Deseada, Mariegalante,
St. Pierre, Miquelon, and, on the main-land, Cayenne,&mdash;each
and all of which the United States guarantied
to France <em>forever</em>, being a <em>continuing guaranty</em>,
so far as this term of law is applicable to an international
transaction, which, beginning “in case of a rupture
between France and England,” was operative after “the
cessation of the present war between the United States
and England,” and was to continue “forever.”</p>

<p>The terms of the “guaranty” are general, and it was
“forever.” Even if limited to <em>defensive</em> war, it would be
difficult to say that France was not engaged in such a
war, with the added incident that it was a war by a
combination of kings to overcome a republic. France
was alone, with the royalties of Europe embattled
against her. Only after the execution of the King England
joined this array, lending to it invincible navies.
But, according to official avowals, it was what King
George called “the atrocious act recently perpetrated at
Paris”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> that finally prompted the part she undertook,
and her real object, in the language of Mr. Fox, was no
other than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> “the destruction of the internal Government
of France.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The case was unprecedented; but it is difficult
to say that it did not come under the “guaranty.”
The <i>casus fœderis</i> had occurred. If France did not exact
performance, that is no reason why our obligations
should be disowned, when, at the present moment, we
are trying to arrive at some appreciation of their extent.
A careful examination of the treaty shows that the
“guaranty” became primarily obligatory on the occurrence
of <em>a rupture between France and England</em>. Nothing
is said or suggested as to the character of the war,
whether offensive or defensive. It is enough that there
was “a rupture.” In such a case, the “guaranty,” according
to the illustration of Cicero, was, <i>tanquam gladius
in vagina</i>, at the disposal of France. Our Secretary
of State, even while seeking to limit its application,
seems to have seen it prospectively in this light, when,
in his instructions of July 15, 1797, to our plenipotentiaries,
Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry, he said,
“Our guaranty of the possessions of France in America
will perpetually expose us to the risk and expense of
war, or to disputes and questions concerning our national
faith.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>2. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce contained a
succession of mutual stipulations, by which the United
States undertook,&mdash;<i>first</i>, to protect and defend by their
ships of war, or convoy, any or all vessels belonging to
French subjects, so long as they hold the same course,
“against all attacks, force, and violence, in the same
manner as they ought to protect and defend” the vessels
of citizens of the United States;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> <i>secondly</i>, to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
their ports to French ships of war and privateers with
their prizes, and to close them against those of any
power at war with France, except when driven by stress
of weather, and then “all proper means shall be vigorously
used that they go out and retire from thence
as soon as possible”;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> <i>thirdly</i>, according to French
construction, to allow French privateers “to fit their
ships, to sell what they have taken, or in any other
manner whatsoever to exchange their ships, merchandise,
or any other lading,” while privateers in enmity
with France are forbidden even to victual in ports of
the United States.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> As if to round and complete these
engagements, it was further stipulated on the part of
the United States, in a Consular Convention, which,
after many perplexities of diplomacy baffling the tried
skill of Franklin, was finally signed by Mr. Jefferson, in
1788, as a postscript to the earlier treaties, that French
consuls and vice-consuls in the United States should
have power and jurisdiction on board French vessels in
civil matters, with the entire inspection over such vessels,
their crews, and the changes and substitutions there
to be made.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Such, briefly recited, were the solemn engagements of
the United States, sanctioned by treaties, as the price
of independence. So long as France remained at peace
with all the world, especially with Great Britain, these
engagements slept unnoticed, but ready, at the first blast
of war, to spring into life. At length the blast was heard,
perhaps as never before in human history, echoing from
capital to capital, and sounding a crusade of monarchical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Europe against republican France. Of all the foreign
ministers at Paris, the minister of the United States
alone remained: the rest had fled.</p>

<p>The minister of the United States saw the danger
lowering upon his own country. In a letter to the
Secretary of State, dated December 21, 1792, after presenting
a rapid sketch of the rising of Europe against
France, he adds: “The circumstance of a war with
Britain becomes important to us in more cases than
one”; and he then alludes to “the question respecting
the <em>guaranty</em> of American possessions, especially if
France should attempt to defend her islands.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Notoriously,
Gouverneur Morris sympathized little with the
French Republic, but, against all arguments for non-compliance
with our original engagements, because the
Government with which they were made had ceased to
exist, his sensitive nature broke forth in the “wish that
all our treaties, however onerous, may be strictly fulfilled
according to their true intent and meaning,” which
he followed in language foreign to the phrases of diplomacy,
by picturing “the honest nation as that which,
like the honest man,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Hath to its plighted faith and vow forever firmly stood;</div>
<div class="verse">And though it promised to its loss, yet makes that promise good.’”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In harmony with this exclamation of the plenipotentiary
are the words of Vattel, an authority much quoted at
the time: “To refuse an ally the succors we owe him,
without any good ground of dispensation, is doing him
an injury, … and there being a natural obligation to
repair the damage caused by our fault, and especially
by our injustice, we are bound to indemnify an ally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
for all the losses he may have sustained from our unjust
refusal.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Since the signature of the treaties times had changed,
and men had changed with them. There was no bad
faith on either side, in the ordinary sense of the term,
but intervening events and exigencies of self-defence
had driven each into unexpected inconsistencies of conduct.
If on one side there was neglect of original engagements,
there was on the other equal neglect of
international duties. The tornado in mad career uprooted
old landmarks, and each was striving to find
new lines of reciprocal relations. Franklin, signing
the “guaranty,” did not expect so soon to call down
upon his country the lightnings of an embattled world;
nor did France, while formally conceding neutral rights
on the ocean and assuring our national independence,
expect so soon to become the plunderer of our commerce.
But the great tragedy would have been less
complete, if its domineering Nemesis had suffered the
two republics to dwell in harmony together. They were
whirled, on each side, into those questionable acts out of
which have sprung the claims and counter-claims now
under consideration.</p>

<p>A new French minister was at hand, accredited to
President Washington, with fresh instructions. Differences
on the obligations of the guaranty appeared in the
Cabinet,&mdash;some holding that no necessity for decision
existed, as France had made no demand,&mdash;and others,
that, the Treaty of Alliance being plainly defensive, the
guaranty did not apply to a war begun by France. After
ample discussion, the Proclamation of Neutrality was
adopted, April 22, 1793, destined to become a turning-point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
in our history. Chief Justice Marshall, whose opportunities
of information were unquestionable, lets us
know that the Proclamation “was intended to prevent
the French minister from demanding <em>the performance of
the guaranty contained in the Treaty of Alliance</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> But
before the Proclamation reached France, orders were issued
there for the capture and confiscation of enemy goods
on board neutral vessels; whereas it was stipulated with
the United States that free ships should make free goods;
so that, even if the denial of the guaranty was wrong,
and the Proclamation, according to French accusation,
“insidious,” the United States were not the first to offend.</p>

<p>On the day of the Proclamation came news by the
journals that Genet, the new French minister, had landed
in South Carolina, where, amid the darkest days of the
Revolution, Lafayette had also first landed. Full of conviction
that France had only to make herself heard in order
to be sustained, Genet exalted himself conspicuously
above the Government. By instructions from the Executive
Council of the French Republic, dated 17th of
January, 1793, he was enjoined “to penetrate profoundly
the sense of the treaties of 1778, and to watch over the
articles favorable to the commerce and navigation of the
United States, and to make the Americans consider engagements
which might appear onerous <em>as the just price
of the independence which the French nation had secured
to them</em>.” Not content with existing safeguards, the new
minister was to negotiate a supplementary treaty, to fix
more surely “the <em>reciprocal guaranty</em> of the possessions
of the two powers.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In this spirit he commenced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
turbulent career, charging offensively that the President,
before knowing what the minister had to communicate
from the French Republic, was in a hurry “to proclaim
sentiments on which decency and friendship should at
least have drawn a veil,”&mdash;that he “took on himself to
give to our treaties arbitrary interpretations absolutely
contrary to their true sense,” and that “he left no other
indemnification to France for the blood she spilt, for the
treasure she dissipated, in fighting for the independence
of the United States, but the illusory advantage of bringing
into their ports the prizes made on their enemies
without being able to sell them,”&mdash;and that the Secretary
of War, on his communication of the wish of the
Windward Islands “to receive promptly some fire-arms
and some cannon, which might put into a state of defence
<em>possessions guarantied by the United States</em>, had the front
to answer, with an ironical carelessness, that the principles
established by the President did not permit him
to lend so much as a pistol.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In another letter, the
French minister, under date of June 8, 1793, requires
that “the Federal Government should observe the public
engagements contracted, and give to the world the
example of a true neutrality, which does not consist in
the cowardly abandonment of friends at the moment
when danger menaces.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And in still another letter,
dated June 22, 1793, he declares that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> “it is in the
conventional compacts, collectively, that we ought to
seek contracts of alliance and of commerce simultaneously
made, if we wish to take their sense and
interpret faithfully the intentions of the people who
cemented them, and of the men of genius who dictated
them.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> All of which was followed by another
letter, dated November 14, 1793, in which the minister
says categorically: “I beg you to lay before the President
of the United States, as soon as possible, the decree
and the inclosed note, and to obtain from him the
earliest decision, <em>either as to the guaranty I have claimed
the fulfilment of for our colonies</em>, or upon the mode of
negotiation of the new treaty I was charged to propose
to the United States, and which would make of the two
nations but one family.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> At last Genet was recalled,
but the question of our engagements with France could
not be dismissed. It was more menacing than any
minister. Without it all the turbulence of Genet
would have been as the idle wind.</p>

<p>And yet, for a while, each party seems to have practised
a certain reserve. Genet stormed, but the Government
at home was tranquil. The “guaranty” was
suspended, even in discussion. France forbore to press
it, and the United States were happy to avoid the over-shadowing
question. The Secretary of State, in instructions
to Mr. Monroe, dated June 10, 1794, while
“insisting upon compensation for the captures and spoliations
of our property and injuries to the persons of
our citizens by French cruisers,” was careful to add:
“If the execution of the <em>guaranty</em> of the French islands
by force of arms should be propounded, you will refer
the Republic of France to this side of the water.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Mr.
Monroe, in his correspondence, under date of September
15, 1794, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> “This Republic had declined calling on
us to execute the guaranty, from a spirit of magnanimity,
and strong attachment to our welfare”; but he reveals
his anxiety lest an attempt to press our case “might give
birth to sentiments of a different kind, and <em>create a disposition
to call on us to execute that of the Treaty of Alliance</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
In another letter, dated November 7, 1794,
describing an interview with the very able Diplomatic
Committee, our plenipotentiary confesses the embarrassment
he encountered, when M. Merlin three times
asked, “Do you insist upon <em>our</em> executing the treaty?”
and he gives his reply, that he “was not instructed by
the President to insist on it, nor did he insist on it”;
and he avows that in his opinion such insistence would
have been impolitic, as “exciting a disposition to press
us on other points, <em>upon which it were better to avoid any
discussion</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> There is other testimony of this nature,
unnecessary to produce. Suffice it to say, that for some
time there was a lull, soon to be followed by a storm.</p>

<p>French forbearance is more remarkable, when it is
considered that the occasion for the “guaranty” had
begun to be urgent. Even before Howe’s great victory
of June, over the French fleet, the British navy
swept the sea, rendering all French possessions insecure.
Martinique, San Domingo, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe
were lost to the Republic in the spring of 1794, so that
the British historian has written: “Thus, in little more
than a month, the French were entirely dispossessed of
their West India possessions, with hardly any loss to
the victorious nation.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But the “guaranty” was invoked
by the impatient colonists, who, without waiting
the slower movement of the French Republic, appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
directly to our Congress for “divers necessary succors,
of provision, ammunition, and even men,” and in impassioned
language pictured “England come to take possession
of the French colonies in the name of a king
without dominions, and North America, witness to that
political perfidy, not able to lend a helping hand against
an unworthy treachery.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The French Government at
home did not share the fury of the colonists. According
to Mr. Monroe, in his letter of December 2, 1794,
whatever may have been their desires at a previous
stage, they did not now wish us to “embark with them
in the war,” but “would rather we would not, from an
idea it might diminish their supplies from America,”
and “if the point depended on them, they would leave
us to act in that respect according to our own wishes”;
at the same time they looked to us for “aid in the article
of money.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This moderation, although a temporary
waiver, was in no respect a renunciation of rights. According
to Mr. Jefferson, in a letter written some months
after his retirement from the Cabinet, and addressed to
Mr. Madison, under date of April 3, 1794, the “guaranty”
was still obligatory. “As to the guaranty of the French
islands,” he wrote, “whatever doubts may be entertained
of the moment at which we ought to interpose, yet <em>I
have no doubt but that we ought to interpose at a proper
time</em>, and declare both to England and France that these
islands are to rest with France, and that we will make
<em>a common cause</em> with the latter for that object.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Such
was American testimony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The West India islands were lost without causing an
apparent smart at home; but it was different, when the
news came of Mr. Jay’s negotiation in England. The
Republic was stung to the quick, and, when the treaty
became known, did not conceal its indignant anger. In
a formal note, dated March 9, 1796, it set forth its complaints,
dwelling especially upon the “inexecution of the
treaties,” and upon the formation of the recent treaty
with Great Britain, in which the United States “knowingly
and evidently sacrificed their connections with
the Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In conversation with Mr. Monroe, the
French minister said “that France had much cause of
complaint against us, independently of our treaty with
England, but that by this treaty ours with them was
annihilated.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The year closed with the recall of Mr.
Monroe, and with a notice from the French Government
“that it will no longer recognize nor receive a Minister
Plenipotentiary from the United States, <em>until after a
reparation of the grievances demanded of the American
Government</em>, and which the French Republic has a
right to expect”; and then, adding ingratitude to the
list of our offences, it declared an equal expectation
“that the successors of Columbus, Raleigh, and Penn,
always proud of their liberty, will never forget that
<em>they owe it to France</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Meanwhile, M. Adet, the
French plenipotentiary in Philadelphia, was addressing
our Government in similar strain, calling for the discharge
of our engagements, and heaping reproaches:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
“The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of the
French Republic, now fulfils to the Secretary of State
of the United States a painful, but sacred duty. <em>He
claims, in the name of American honor, in the name of
the faith of treaties, the execution of that contract which
assured to the United States their existence</em>, and which
France regarded as the pledge of the most sacred union
between two people the freest upon earth.” And he
charges the Government of the United States with
“sacrificing France to her enemies,” “forgetting the services
that she had rendered it,” and “throwing aside
the duty of gratitude, as if ingratitude was a Governmental
duty.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> From this time forward the claims of
the United States never failed to encounter the counter-claims
of France.</p>

<p>The mutual coquetry which characterized the two
Governments during the mission of Mr. Monroe gave
way to mutual recrimination and repulsion, where France
took the lead. M. Adet was recalled from Philadelphia.
Mr. Pinckney was sent away from Paris. Besides the
earlier decree, announcing that the Republic would
treat all neutrals in the same manner as they suffered
the English to treat them, other fatal blows were now
dealt at our commerce, letting loose a new brood of spoliations
destined to swell the catalogue of our claims,
by a decree pronouncing the stipulations of the treaty
of 1778 which concerned the neutrality of the flags altered
and suspended in their most essential points by
the treaty with England, greatly enlarging the list of
contraband, declaring Americans in the service of England
pirates, and authorizing the seizure of all American
vessels without a <i>rôle d’équipage</i>, which, notoriously,
no American vessel ever carried, so that practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
our flag was delivered over to the depredations of every
French cruiser.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Then came that plenipotentiary triumvirate, Messrs.
Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry, who were particularly
instructed by our Government, while urging the multiplied
claims of our citizens, already valued at “more
than twenty millions of dollars,” to propose “a substitute
for the reciprocal guaranty,” or, “if France insists
on the mutual guaranty, to aim at some modification of
it,”&mdash;“instead of troops or ships of war, to stipulate
for a moderate sum of money or quantity of provisions,
at the option of France: the provisions to be delivered
at our own ports, in any future <em>defensive</em> wars; the sum
of money, or its value in provisions, not to exceed two
hundred thousand dollars a year, during any such wars.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Here was recognition of the “guaranty,” and a sum
offered for release from its requirements. But the
French Republic, drunk with triumph and maddened
with anger, was in no mood for negotiation. It met
our plenipotentiaries with an intrigue already mentioned
as unparalleled in diplomacy, and, after tolerating their
presence for a while at Paris, without conceding an official
reception, sent them away, disappointed and dishonored.
Even in the informal relations which were
permitted, Talleyrand, in the name of the Republic, advanced
and vindicated the counter-claims of France.
Without dwelling at length on his argument, it is
enough to quote certain words in a letter to Mr. Gerry,
of June 10, 1798:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> “<em>The French Republic desires to be
restored to the rights which its treaties with your Republic
confer upon it, and through those means it desires to assure
yours. You claim indemnities; it equally demands
them</em>; and this disposition, being as sincere on the part
of the Government of the United States as it is on its
part, will speedily remove all the difficulties.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Thus
plainly was the case stated. It was not denied that
indemnities were due to the United States, but it was
insisted that they were also due to France.</p>

<p>The two countries, once allies, were now in the most
painful relations. Washington was no longer President;
but his Farewell Address, in some of its most important
parts, was evidently inspired by the counter-claims of
France, especially when he warned his fellow-countrymen
“to steer clear of <em>permanent alliances</em> with any portion
of the foreign world, <em>so far as we are now at liberty
to do it</em>,”&mdash;“to have with foreign nations as little <em>political</em>
connection as possible,”&mdash;“to be constantly awake
against the insidious wiles of foreign influence,”&mdash;and
then asked in well-known words, “Why quit our own,
to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by <em>interweaving
our destiny with that of any part of Europe</em>, entangle our
peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition,
rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In these remarkable
words, where the same tone, if not the same
lesson, recurs, we discern the undissembled anxieties of
the hour. By the guaranty and other stipulations of
1778, our peace and prosperity had been entangled,
even if our destiny had not been interwoven, in distant
toils. France was urgent and brutal. War seemed
impending. At last another triumvirate of plenipotentiaries,
Messrs. Ellsworth, Davie, and Murray, was
commissioned to attempt again the adjustment of complications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
that had thus far baffled the wisdom of
Washington; but compensation for the “individual”
claims of American citizens was required as an indispensable
condition.</p>

<p>Such are the counter-claims of France in origin and
history. And now again we are brought to the very
point where the Committee had arrived in exhibiting
the claims of our citizens. The plenipotentiaries on
each side have met to negotiate, while the First Consul
has gone to Marengo. On each side they are equally
tenacious. There is a dead-lock. How this was overcome
belongs to the next chapter.</p>


<h4>III.<br />
ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
FRANCE BY THE SET-OFF AND MUTUAL RELEASE OF
CLAIMS AND COUNTER-CLAIMS.</h4>

<p>The rules of duty and of conduct between individuals
are applicable also to nations, and the proceedings
on this occasion illustrate this principle. The two parties
could not agree. Clearly, then, for the sake of
harmony, it was essential to postpone both claims and
counter-claims, for some future negotiation, or, if this
were not done, to treat them as a set-off to each other.
Such, unquestionably, would have been the action between
individuals. But the history of this negotiation
shows the adoption of these two modes successively.
Postponement was first tried, but it gave way at last to
<em>set-off</em>, by virtue of which the <em>international</em> controversy
was closed. This conclusion was reached slowly and
by stages, as is seen in a simple narrative of the negotiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The plenipotentiaries on each side evinced a disposition
to provide for reciprocal claims; but the claims
specified by the American plenipotentiaries were those
of “<em>citizens</em> of either nation,” while those specified by
the French plenipotentiaries were those which “either
nation may make for <em>itself</em> or for any of its citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
In this difference of specification was the germ of
the antagonism soon developed, especially when the
American plenipotentiaries proposed to recognize the
treaties and Consular Convention as existing only to
July 7, 1798,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> the date of the statute by which Congress
undertook to annul them. This distinction seems
to have been unnecessary, for the French spoliations
were clearly as much in contravention of the Law
of Nations as of the treaties. But it furnished the
French plenipotentiaries opportunity of declaring, under
date of May 6, 1800, that “the mission of the
Ministers Plenipotentiary of the French Republic has
pointed out to them the Treaties of Alliance, Friendship,
and Commerce, and the Consular Convention, <em>as
the only foundations of their negotiations</em>”; that “upon
these acts has arisen the misunderstanding, and it
seems proper that upon these acts union and friendship
should be established.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Thus were the treaties
put forward by France; and our plenipotentiaries, writing
to their own Government, May 17, 1800, represent
her as persistent: “Our success is yet doubtful. The
French think it hard to indemnify for violating engagements,
<em>unless they can thereby be restored to the
benefits of them</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But on this point our Government
was inexorable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The return of the First Consul from Italy was signalized
by fresh instructions to the French plenipotentiaries,
who proceeded to declare, under date of August
11, 1800, that “the treaties which united France and
the United States are not broken,” and that their first
proposition is “to stipulate a full and entire recognition
of the treaties, and the reciprocal engagement of compensation
for damages resulting on both sides from their
infraction.” Here, again, the “individual” claims of citizens
of the United States were doomed to encounter
the “national” claims of France. And this communication
concluded with a formal proposition in these
words: “Either the ancient treaties, with the privileges
resulting from priority and the stipulation of reciprocal
indemnities, or a new treaty, assuring equality without
indemnity.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Thus it stood: Claims and Counter-Claims.</p>

<p>The American plenipotentiaries were driven to choose
between abandonment of the negotiations and abandonment
of their instructions. It was clear, from French
persistency, that the treaties, with all the counter-claims,
must be recognized, or the indemnities, with all
the claims, must be sacrificed. The American plenipotentiaries
then took the extraordinary responsibility
of a proposition which discloses not only their earnest
desire for a settlement, but also their sense of pressure
from France. It was nothing less than a price, in money,
for release from certain stipulations; but this was to be
accomplished by “a reciprocal stipulation for <em>indemnities
limited to the claims of individuals</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The French
plenipotentiaries, in reply, insisted upon recognition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the treaties in general terms, and also the rights of their
privateers in our ports; yet they offered to commute
the guaranty for a sum of money.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The American
plenipotentiaries, hampered by the recent treaty with
Great Britain, were obliged to reject this proposition;
but, after requiring the satisfaction of “individual”
claims, they offered, in general terms, that “the former
treaties be renewed and confirmed, and have the same
effect as if no misunderstanding between the two powers
had intervened”; and further, that, <em>in consideration
of eight millions of francs</em>, the United States should
be released from the guaranty, and also from those
other articles relating to prizes which had caused so
much embarrassment.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Then the French plenipotentiaries
assumed a new position in the following reply,
September 4, 1800.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>To the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States at
Paris</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We shall have the right to take our prizes into the ports
of America.</p>

<p>“A commission shall regulate the indemnities which either
of the two nations may owe to the citizens of the other.</p>

<p>“<em>The indemnities which shall be due by France to the citizens
of the United States shall be paid for by the United States.
And in return for which, France yields the exclusive privilege
resulting from the 17th and 22d articles of the Treaty of Commerce,
and from the rights of guaranty of the 11th article of
the Treaty of Alliance.</em></p>

<p class="sig3 noindent">“<span class="smcap">Bonaparte.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">C. P. Claret-Fleurieu.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Roederer.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was the first proposition of <em>set-off</em>. On the one
side were “indemnities due by France to citizens of
the United States,” and on the other side were “privileges
and rights” under the treaties; but it will not
fail to be remarked that <em>the indemnities due by France
were to be paid by the United States</em>. This proposition
proceeded on the idea that the counter-claims of
France were at least equal in value to the claims of
the United States, and that the release of the former
was a sufficient consideration for the assumption of
the latter. But this was entirely beyond the powers
of the American plenipotentiaries, who, in their reply,
pronounced it “inadmissible.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It revealed the desire
of France to escape any payment of money, as only
a few days later was openly avowed by the French
plenipotentiaries, “giving as one reason the utter inability
of France to pay, in the situation in which
she would be left by the present war.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> This declared
inability served to explain the difficulties encountered
by the American plenipotentiaries. Evidently there
was a “foregone conclusion” against any payment by
France. The counter-claims furnished the needed <em>substitute</em>.
But, as these were “national,” while the claims
of the United States were “individual,” there could be
no just <em>set-off</em> between them, unless the American Government
assured to its citizens the payment of what
was due from France, according to the proposition of
the French plenipotentiaries.</p>

<p>The American plenipotentiaries were disheartened.
Nothing in their instructions enabled them to meet
the new and unexpected turn of affairs. The treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
they had striven for seemed to elude their grasp. In
their journal, under date of September 13, 1800, is the
record, that, “being now convinced that the door was
perfectly closed against all hope of obtaining indemnities
with any modifications of the treaties, it only remained
to be determined whether, under all circumstances,
it would not be expedient to attempt <em>a temporary
arrangement</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The French plenipotentiaries
did not consider this proposition, without insisting,
“first, that a stipulation of indemnities carries with
it the full and entire admission of the treaties, and,
secondly, that the relinquishment of the advantages
and privileges stipulated by the treaties, by means of
the reciprocal relinquishment of indemnities, would
prove to be the most advantageous arrangement, and
also the most honorable to the two nations.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Here,
again, was a proposition of <em>set-off</em>, which was repeated
in other different forms.</p>

<p>The dead-lock which clogged the negotiation, even
at the beginning, was now complete. The American
plenipotentiaries announced at home that they were
driven to quit France, or to find some other terms of
adjustment.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The latter alternative prevailed, and the
negotiation was renewed, with the understanding that
the parties put off to another time the discussion of
indemnities and the treaties.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The other questions
furnished no ground of serious controversy; and the
conferences proceeded tranquilly, from day to day, till
September 30, 1800, resulting in what was entitled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
“<em>Provisional</em> Treaty.” The title revealing its temporary
character was subsequently changed, at the request
of the French plenipotentiaries, to that of “Convention,”
which it now bears in the statute-book.</p>

<p>The Convention, after declaring in its first article
that “there shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal
peace, and a true and sincere friendship, between the
French Republic and the United States of America,”
proceeds to stipulate as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The Ministers Plenipotentiary of the two parties
not being able to agree at present respecting the Treaty
of Alliance of 6th February, 1778, the Treaty of Amity and
Commerce of the same date, and the Convention of 14th
of November, 1788, nor upon the indemnities mutually
due or claimed, the parties will negotiate further on these
subjects at a convenient time; and until they may have
agreed upon these points, the said treaties and convention
shall have no operation, and the relations of the two countries
shall be regulated as follows.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the disagreement with regard to the early treaties
and the indemnities mutually due or claimed is
specifically declared, and it is then provided that
“<em>the parties</em> will negotiate further on these subjects
at a convenient time,”&mdash;meaning, of course, that hereafter,
at a more auspicious moment, and with other
plenipotentiaries, “the parties” will attempt to reconcile
this disagreement. The whole subject, with its
seven years of controversy and heart-burning, was postponed.
Claims and counter-claims were left to sleep,
while the spirit of peace descended upon the two
countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The Convention was signed at Morfontaine, the elegant
country home of Joseph Bonaparte, and the occasion
was turned into a festival,&mdash;illustrated afterwards
by the engraving of Piranesi,&mdash;where nothing was wanting
that hospitality could supply. The First Consul was
there, with his associates in power; also Lafayette, rescued
from his Austrian dungeon and restored to France;
and there also were the plenipotentiaries of both sides,
with American citizens then in France, all gathered in
brilliant company to celebrate the establishment of concord
between the two republics.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The First Consul
proposed as a toast, “<i>To the manes of the French and
the Americans who died on the field of battle for the independence
of the New World</i>”; so that even at this generous
festival, to grace a reconciliation founded on the
postponement of claims and counter-claims, the youthful
chief, whose star was beginning to fill the heavens,
proclaimed the undying obligations of the United States
to France. This strain has been adopted by M. Thiers,
who, after referring to this convention as the first concluded
by the Consular Government, says: “It was natural
that the reconciliation of France with the different
powers of the globe should begin with <em>that republic
to which she had in a measure given birth</em>.” The great
historian, while thus recording our obligations to France,
shows how claims and counter-claims had been postponed.
“The First Consul,” he says, “had allowed the
difficulties relative to the Treaty of Alliance of the
6th of February, 1778, to be adjourned; but, on the
other hand, he had required the adjournment of the
claims of the Americans relative to captured vessels.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
In this summary the stipulations at the signature of
the Convention are accurately stated. Though imperfect,
it was the first in that procession of peace, embracing
Lunéville, Amiens, and the Concordat, which
for a moment closed the Temple of Janus, whose gates
had been left open by the Revolution in France.</p>

<p>The ratification by the First Consul followed the
celebration at Morfontaine, so that the Convention,
with its postponement of mutual claims, was definitely
accepted by France. It was otherwise in the United
States, where the result did not find favor. The postponement
of a controversy is not a settlement, and
here was nothing but postponement, leaving the old
cloud hanging over the country, ready to burst at the
motion of England or France. It was important that
the early treaties, with their entangling engagements,
should cease, even as a subject of future negotiation.
In this spirit, the Senate, on the submission of the Convention
for ratification, expunged the second article,
providing that “the parties will negotiate further on
these subjects,” and limited the Convention to eight
years. On the 18th of February, 1801, President Adams,
by proclamation countersigned by John Marshall, as
Secretary of State, published the Convention as duly
ratified, “saving and excepting the second article,” which
was declared “to be expunged, and of no force or validity.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
The precise effect of this proceeding was not
explained, and it remained to see how it would be regarded
in France.</p>

<p>Were the claims on France abandoned? This was
the question which occupied the attention of our minister,
Mr. Murray, when charged to exchange with France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the ratifications of the Convention as amended by the
Senate. Reporting to the Government at home his conference
with the French plenipotentiaries, he said, “I
fear that they will press an article of formal abandonment
on our part, <em>which I shall evade</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> He hoped, to
keep still another chance for indemnities. On the other
hand, the French plenipotentiaries feared that an unconditional
suppression of the second article would
leave them exposed to the claims of the United States
without chance for their counter-claims; but they did
not object to a mutual abandonment of indemnities,
which Mr. Murray admitted would “always be <em>set off</em>
against each other.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> At last the conclusion was
reached, and on the 31st of July, 1801, the Convention
was ratified by the First Consul, with the limitation
to eight years, and with the retrenchment of the
second article, according to the amendment by the Senate,
the whole with a proviso by the First Consul “<span class="smcap">That
by this retrenchment the two states renounce the
respective pretensions which are the object of the
said article</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Such were the important words of final
settlement. What had been left to inference in the
amendment of the Senate was placed beyond question
by this French proviso. Claims and counter-claims
were not merely suspended; they were formally abandoned.
The Convention, with this decisive modification,
was submitted to the Senate by President Jefferson,
and again ratified by a vote of twenty-two yeas to
four nays. On the 21st of December, 1801, it was promulgated
by the President in the usual form, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
supplementary proviso, and all persons were enjoined
to observe and fulfil the same, “and every clause and
article thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>One aspect of this result cannot fail to arrest attention.
Here was a release of all outstanding obligations
of the United States under those famous treaties which
assured National Independence. The joy with which
those heralds of triumph were first welcomed in camp
and Congress has been portrayed; and now a kindred
joy prevailed, when the country, anxious and sorely
tried, was at last set free from their obligations, and
American commerce, venturing forth again from its
banishment, brought back its treasures to pour them
into the lap of the people. Strange fate! There was
joy at the birth of these treaties, and joy also at their
death. But it was because their death had become to
us, like their birth, a source of national strength and
security.</p>

<p>Thus closed a protracted controversy, where each
power was persistent to the last. Nothing could be
more simple than the adjustment, and nothing more
equitable, <em>if we regard the two Governments only</em>. The
claims of each were treated as a <em>set-off</em> to the claims of
the other, and <em>mutual releases</em> were interchanged, so that
each, while losing what it claimed, triumphed over its
adversary. But the triumph of the United States was
at the expense of American citizens. Nothing is without
price; and new duties, originating in this triumph,
sprang into being.</p>

<h4>IV.<br />
ASSUMPTION OF CLAIMS BY THE UNITED STATES, AND
SUBSTITUTION OF UNITED STATES FOR FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Then came the assumption by our Government of
the original obligations of France, and its complete
<em>substitution</em> for France <em>as the responsible debtor</em>. This
liability was distinctly foreseen by the American plenipotentiaries,
Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry,
as appears in their words, under date of October 22,
1797: “We observed to M. Bellamy, that none of
our vessels had what the French termed a <i>rôle d’équipage</i>,
and that, if we were to surrender all the property
which had been taken from our citizens in cases
where their vessels were not furnished with such a rôle,
<em>the Government would be responsible to its citizens for
the property so surrendered</em>, since it would be impossible
to undertake to assert that there was any plausibility
in the allegation that our treaty required a <i>rôle
d’équipage</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This admission, so important in this discussion,
was so clearly in conformity with correct principles,
that it was naturally made, even without special
instructions.</p>

<p>Had the claims been “national” on each side, no
subsequent question could have occurred, for each
would have extinguished the other in all respects forever.
It was the peculiarity of this case, that on one
side the claims were “national,” and on the other
side “individual.” But a <em>set-off</em> of “individual” claims
against “national” claims must, of course, leave that
Government responsible which has appropriated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
“individual” claims to this purpose. The set-off and
mutual release are between nation and nation; but if
the claims on one side are only “individual,” and not
“national,” the nation which by virtue of this consideration
is released from “national” obligations must
be <em>substituted</em> for the other nation as debtor, so that
every “individual” with claims thus appropriated may
confidently turn to it for satisfaction. On this point
there can be no doubt, whether we regard it in the
light of common sense, reason, duty, Constitution, or
authority.</p>

<p>1. According to <em>common sense</em>, any “individual” interest
appropriated to a “national” purpose must create
a debt on the part of the nation, still further enhanced,
if, through this appropriation, the nation is
relieved from outstanding engagements already the
occasion of infinite embarrassment, and hanging like
a drawn sword over the future.</p>

<p>2. According to <em>reason</em>, any person intrusted with
the guardianship of particular interests becomes personally
responsible with regard to them, especially if
he undertakes to barter them against other interests for
which he is personally responsible. Thus, an attorney,
sacrificing the claims of his clients for the release of
his own personal obligations, becomes personally liable;
and so also the trustee, appropriating the trust fund for
any personal interest, becomes personally liable. All
this is too plain for argument; but it is applicable to
a nation as to an individual. In the case now before
your Committee, our Government was attorney to prosecute
“individual” claims of citizens, and also trustee
for their benefit, to watch and protect their interests;
so that it was bound to all the responsibilities of attorney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and trustee, absolutely incapacitated from any
act of personal advantage, and compelled to regard all
that it obtained, whatever form of value it might assume,
whether money or release, as a trust fund for
the original claimants.</p>

<p>3. <em>Duty</em>, also, in harmony with reason, enjoins upon
Government the protection of citizens against foreign
spoliations and the prosecution of their claims to
judgment. Such are powerless as “individuals.” Their
claims are effective only when adopted by the nation.
This duty, so obvious on general principles, was reinforced
in the present case by the special undertaking of
Mr. Jefferson, already adduced, when he announced that
he had it “in charge from the President to assure the
merchants of the United States concerned in foreign
commerce or navigation, that due attention will be paid
to any injuries they may suffer on the high seas or in
foreign countries.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Such a duty, thus founded, and
thus openly assumed, could not be abandoned, on any
inducement proceeding from France, without a corresponding
responsibility toward those citizens whose
interests were allowed to suffer. A waiver of national
duty, especially where made for the national benefit,
must entail national obligation.</p>

<p>4. The <em>Constitution</em> also plainly requires what seems
so obvious to common sense, reason, and duty, when it
declares that “private property shall not be taken for
public use <em>without just compensation</em>.” Here “private
property,” to a vast amount, was taken for “public use,”
involving the peace and welfare of the whole country;
and down to this day the sufferers are petitioning Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
for that “just compensation” solemnly promised
by the Constitution.</p>

<p>5. <em>Public law</em> is also in harmony with the Constitution.
According to Vattel, the sovereign may, in the
exercise of his right of eminent domain, dispose of the
property, and even the person, of a subject, by treaty
with a foreign power; “but,” says this eminent authority,
“as it is for the public advantage that he thus
disposes of them, the state is bound to indemnify the
citizens who are sufferers by the transaction.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Words
more applicable to the present case could not be employed.</p>

<p>6. The authority of great names confirms this liability.
Among those who took part in the negotiations
with France, none but Mr. Pickering and Chief Justice
Marshall still lingered on the stage when the subject
was finally pressed upon Congress. Mr. Pickering
was Secretary of State under Washington and Adams,
and drew the instructions. His testimony is explicit.
Without giving his statement at length, it will be
enough to quote these words, in a letter dated November
19, 1824:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus the Government <em>bartered</em> the <em>just claims</em> of our
merchants on France, to obtain a relinquishment of the
French claim for a restoration of the old treaties, especially
the burdensome Treaty of Alliance, by which we were
bound to guaranty the French territories in America. On
this view of the case, it would seem <em>that the merchants have
an equitable claim for indemnities from the United States</em>.…
It follows, then, that, if the relinquishment had not
been made, the present French Government would be responsible.
Consequently, the relinquishment by our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Government having been made in consideration that the
French Government relinquished its demand for a renewal
of the old treaties, <em>then it seems clear, that, as our Government
applied the merchants’ property to buy off those old
treaties, the sums so applied should be reimbursed</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Chief Justice Marshall, who was one of the plenipotentiaries
that attempted to secure payment from
France, and afterward, as Secretary of State, countersigned
the proclamation of President Adams first promulgating
the Convention of 1800, has borne testimony
similar to that of Mr. Pickering. In conversation with
Mr. Preston, of South Carolina, he said, that, “having
been connected with the events of that period, and
conversant with the circumstances under which the
claims arose, <em>he was, from his own knowledge, satisfied
that there was the strongest obligation on the Government
to compensate the sufferers by the French spoliations</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Hon. B. Watkins Leigh, an ancient Senator from
Virginia, relates that the same eminent authority said
in his presence, “distinctly and positively, that <em>the
United States ought to make payment of these claims</em>.”
This declaration made a particular impression upon
Mr. Leigh, because he had been unfavorable to the
claims.</p>

<p>7. The obligation of the United States may be inferred
also from <em>the declared justice</em> of the claims which
had been renounced. On this point the authority is
equally explicit.</p>

<p>Of course, in urging them upon France, earnestly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
most assiduously, by successive plenipotentiaries, there
was a plain adoption of them as just. But even after
their abandonment they continued to be recognized as
just.</p>

<p>Hon. Robert R. Livingston, plenipotentiary at Paris,
in his correspondence shortly after the abandonment,
shows his discontent. In a note to the Minister of
Exterior Relations he speaks compendiously of “the
payment for illegal captures, with damages and indemnities
on one side, and the renewal of the Treaty
of 1778 on the other, as of <em>equivalent value</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> And
in a despatch, under date of January 13, 1802, he says
he has “always considered the sacrifices we have made
of an immense claim as <em>a dead loss</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> But this “dead
loss” fell upon “individuals,” and not upon the “nation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Madison, as Secretary of State, in a despatch to
Hon. Charles Pinckney, our minister at the court of
Spain, under date of February 6, 1804, upholds the justice
of the claims in significant words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The claims from which France was released were <em>admitted
by France</em>, and the release was for <em>a valuable consideration</em>
in a correspondent release of the United States from certain
claims on them.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, according to official declaration, the claims of
American citizens were “admitted by France,” but they
were released for <em>a valuable consideration</em> which first
inured to the benefit of the Government of the United
States. <em>Equitably, that valuable consideration must belong
to the claimants.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Clay, as Secretary of State under John Quincy
Adams, made a report, which had the sanction of the latter,
where he fully affirms the justice of the claims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The pretensions of the United States arose out of the
spoliations, under color of French authority, in contravention
to law and existing treaties. Those of France sprung from
the Treaty of Alliance of the 6th February, 1778, the Treaty
of Amity and Commerce of the same date, and the Convention
of the 14th of November, 1788. Whatever obligations or
indemnities from those sources either party had a right to
demand were respectively waived and abandoned, <em>and the
consideration which induced one party to renounce his pretensions
was that of the renunciation by the other party of his
pretensions</em>. What was the value of the obligations and indemnities
so reciprocally renounced can only be matter of
speculation.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Clay concludes by declaring that the Senate, to
which his report is addressed, was most competent to
determine how far the appropriation of the indemnities
due to American citizens was “a public use of private
property, within the spirit of the Constitution, and
whether equitable considerations do not require some
compensation to be made to the claimants.”</p>

<p>There is one other authority, of commanding character,
not to be forgotten. It is Hon. Edward Livingston,
jurist, statesman, and diplomatist, who, though not engaged
in the negotiations, knew them as contemporary,
and afterward, as Senator, made a report, accepted ever
since as an authentic statement of the whole case, in
which he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Committee think it is sufficiently shown that the
claim for indemnities was surrendered <em>as an equivalent</em> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the discharge of the United States from its heavy national
obligations, and for the damages that were due for their
preceding non-performance of them. If so, can there be a
doubt, independent of the constitutional provision, that the
sufferers are entitled to indemnity? Under that provision
<em>is not this right converted into one that we are under the most
solemn obligation to satisfy?</em> … To lessen the public expenditure
is a great legislative duty; to lessen it at the
expense of justice, public faith, and constitutional right
would be a crime. Conceiving that all these require that
relief should be granted to the petitioners, they pray leave
to bring in a bill for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This list of authorities may be closed with that of
the Emperor Napoleon, who, at St. Helena, dictated to
Gourgaud the following testimony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The suppression of this article [2d of the Convention]
at once put an end to the privileges which France had possessed
by the Treaty of 1778, <em>and annulled the just claims
which America might have made for injuries done in time of
peace</em>. This was exactly what the First Consul had proposed
to himself, in fixing these two points <em>as equiponderating each
other</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus the head of the French Government at the time
of the Convention unites with the statesmen of our
own country in attaching value to these claims.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To all this array of argument and authority the Committee
see no answer. They follow its teaching, when
they adopt the conclusion, in which so many previous
committees have already joined, that these individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
claims were originally just, and that the Government
of the United States, having appropriated them for a
“national” purpose, was substituted for France as
debtor.</p>


<h3>OBJECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Assuming the obligation of the United States, the
question occurs, What sum should be applied by Congress
to its liquidation? But before proceeding to this
point, the Committee will glance at what is urged sometimes
against this obligation, so far at least as they are
aware of opposition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Objections of a preliminary character have been already
considered; but there are others belonging properly
to this stage of the inquiry.</p>

<p>Curiously, the two main objections most often adduced
answer each other flatly. It is sometimes insisted
that the claims were invalid, by reason of the
abnormal relations between France and the United
States anterior to the Convention of 1800, pronounced
to be a state of war; and then, again, it is sometimes
insisted that these claims were provided for in the subsequent
Convention of 1803 for the purchase of Louisiana.
But, if the claims were really invalid, as has been
argued, it is absurd to suppose that France would have
provided for them; and if they were really provided
for, it is equally absurd to suppose that they were
invalid. The two objections might be dismissed as
equally unreasonable; but, since they have been made
to play a conspicuous part, especially in Presidential
vetoes, the Committee will occupy a brief moment in
considering them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Other objections, founded on the later Convention of
1831, on the Act of Congress annulling the French
treaties, on the early efforts of the United States to
procure satisfaction from France, and on the alleged
desperate character of the claims, will be considered
in their order.</p>


<h4>I.&mdash;WAR DID NOT EXIST BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND FRANCE.</h4>

<p>The anomalous relations between France and the
United States anterior to the Convention of 1800
did not constitute a state of war so as to annul all
pending claims. The contrary assertion is inconsistent
with (1.) the facts of the case, (2.) the declarations
of the two parties, and (3.) the nature of the
Convention.</p>

<p>Before considering these several topics, it may be
remarked, that, had there been a state of war, it would
not follow that all prior rights otherwise valid were annulled,
so at least as not to be revived at the close of
the war. On one important occasion, the contrary has
been held by our Government in its negotiations with
Great Britain. The provision relative to the fisheries
which appears in the Treaty of 1783 was not noticed
in the Treaty of Ghent; and yet the United States did
not hesitate to insist afterwards, that, though interrupted
by the War of 1812, it remained in full force after
the termination of the war. Doubtless, claims bearing
the open cause of war, and failing to be recognized in
the treaty of peace, are annulled; for the treaty is the
settlement of pending controversies between the two
powers. But the claims in question were not the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
cause even of the anomalous relations between the United
States and France, and they did not fail to have
such recognition in the convention terminating those
relations as to exclude all idea that they were annulled
by war, or any other antecedent facts. It is
not necessary to consider the effect of war, for it is
easy to establish that war did not exist.</p>

<p>1. The facts of the case are all inconsistent with
war. There was no declaration of war on either side;
and, still further, throughout the whole duration of the
troubles the tribunals of each country were open to
citizens of the other, as in times of peace; so that a
citizen of the United States was not an “alien enemy”
in the courts of France, nor a Frenchman an “alien
enemy” in the courts of the United States. This fact,
which was presented by Mr. Clayton in his masterly
discussion of the question, is most suggestive, if not
conclusive.</p>

<p>It is true that diplomatic and commercial intercourse
was suspended, that the two powers armed, and that
on both sides force was employed. But this painful
condition of things, though naturally causing great
anxiety, did not constitute war. One power may, in
its own discretion, suspend diplomatic and commercial
intercourse with another; it may assume all the harness
of war, and even use force in retaliation, retortion,
or reprisal; but all this falls short of war, <em>especially
when public acts and declarations show that war was not
intended</em>. Such conduct tends to war, and, if continued,
naturally ends in war. But it is not of itself that
terrible transformation by which one nation, with all
its people, is converted into the enemy of another nation,
with all its people, so that every citizen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
one becomes the enemy of every citizen of the other,
and all pending rights and contracts between them disappear,
at least for a time.</p>

<p>If war be the extinguisher of claims, it is because,
in theory, the claimant is supposed to have opportunity
for reparation by seizing the property of the enemy,
wherever he can find it on the high seas. But no
reprisals against France were authorized by the United
States; no war on private property was permitted; so
that the only principle on which war is the extinguisher
of claims fails to apply.</p>

<p>But not even an act of war constitutes war. The
two parties determine if war exists. To their public
acts and mutual declarations we repair for interpretation
of their conduct.</p>

<p>2. On the part of the United States <em>the declarations
are explicit</em> that war did not exist, although it seemed
imminent. Congress was convened in May, 1797, to
deliberate on the threatening aspect of affairs, and
adopt measures of public defence, which were continued
in 1798 and 1799; but in all this series of acts
there is constant and sedulous negation of the state
of war. The Act of May 28, 1798, after reciting that
“armed vessels sailing under authority or pretence of
authority from the Republic of France have committed
depredations on the commerce of the United States,
and have recently captured the vessels and property of
citizens thereof on and near the coasts,” proceeds to
authorize the seizure of any such armed vessel; but
nothing is said of war.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Another Act, bearing date the
same day, authorizes a provisional army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> “<em>in the event
of a declaration of war</em> against the United States, or of
actual invasion of their territory by a foreign power,
or of imminent danger of such invasion discovered in
the opinion of the President to exist, <em>before the next
session of Congress</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The Act of June 13, 1798, to
continue in force only till the end of the next session,
and renewed February 9, 1799, for a limited term, suspended
commercial relations between the two countries,
under penalties of forfeiture;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> but such acts,
however menacing, are absolutely inconsistent with an
existing state of war, which of itself, without any additional
act, suspends all commercial relations between
the belligerent parties. The Act of June 25, 1798, authorizes
our merchant vessels to subdue and capture
any French armed vessel <em>from which an assault or other
hostility shall be first made</em>.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The Act of July 6, 1798,
respecting alien enemies, begins with the words of limitation,
“<em>Whenever there shall be a declared war</em> between
the United States and any foreign nation.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
The Act of July 7, 1798, declares the treaties no longer
“legally obligatory”;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> but if war existed, such an
act would have been superfluous. The Act of July
16, 1798, authorizes augmentation of the army “for
and during the continuance of <em>the existing differences</em>
between the United States and the French Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
The Act of March 2, 1799, also authorizes augmentation
of the army, “<em>in case war shall break out</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Another
Act, passed the next day, provides that certain
troops authorized by the Act shall not be raised, “<em>unless
war shall break out</em> between the United States and
some European prince, potentate, or state.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
late as February 20, 1800, while our envoys were on
the way to Paris, another Act was passed, providing
that further enlistments should be suspended, “<em>unless</em>,
in the recess of Congress, and during the continuance
of <em>the existing differences</em> between the United States and
the French Republic, <em>war shall break out</em> between the
United States and the French Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> All these
cumulative measures refer to war, not as actually existing,
but only as a future possibility. Meanwhile
there were “existing differences” only. Finally, on
the 14th of May, 1800, four months before the signature
of the Convention, and when the plenipotentiaries
on each side were at a dead-lock, another Act was
passed, authorizing the abandonment of the military
preparations set on foot in contemplation of the contingency
of war.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Such is a synopsis of testimony
from Congressional legislation. And now, when it is
considered that Congress alone, under the Constitution,
has power to declare war, that it never made any declaration
of war against France, and that throughout
this whole period of trouble, in its whole series of
acts, it expressly negatived the fact of war, is it not
impossible to assert, that, according to the understanding
of our Government, war actually existed? What
Congress did, and what it failed to do, answer in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>The declarations of the Executive are as explicit as
the declarations of Congress. In the instructions to
our plenipotentiaries, under date of October 22, 1799,
the Secretary of State, after mentioning the spoliations
of France, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> “This conduct of the French Republic
would well have justified an immediate declaration of
war on the part of the United States; but, <em>desirous of
maintaining peace</em>, and still willing to leave open the
door of reconciliation with France, <em>the United States
contented themselves with preparations for defence</em> and
measures calculated to protect their commerce.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> These
plenipotentiaries declared to the French, under date of
April 11, 1800, that the Acts of Congress, “<em>far from
contemplating a coöperation with the enemies of the Republic</em>,
did not even authorize reprisals upon her merchantmen,
but were restricted solely to the giving of
safety to their own, till a moment should arrive when
their sufferings could be heard and redressed.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Again,
in a despatch to our minister in England, under date
of September 20, 1800, the Secretary of State, who was
none other than John Marshall, says: “The aggressions
sometimes of one and sometimes of another belligerent
power have forced us <em>to contemplate and to
prepare for war as a probable event</em>”:<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> not as an
actual event already arrived, but only as a probable
event. In the face of such declarations, who can
say that war existed?</p>

<p>On the part of France the declarations are equally
explicit. It is true, that, on the 12th September, 1800,
in conversation, the French plenipotentiaries let drop
fitful words, to the effect, that, “if the question could
be determined by an indifferent nation, such a tribunal
would say that the present state of things was war
on the side of America, and that no indemnities could
be claimed.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> But the context shows, that, to avoid
the payment of these indemnities, they were driven to
every possible subterfuge; and the whole suggestion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
contrary to all the admissions of the French Government,
both in the executive and legislative branches.
Indeed, these very plenipotentiaries of France, in a
formal communication to the American plenipotentiaries,
under date of August 11, 1800, declared that “<em>the
state of misunderstanding</em> which has existed for some
time between France and the United States, by the act
of some agents rather than by the will of the respective
Governments, <em>has not been a state of war, at least
on the side of France</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> We have already seen that
it was not on the side of the United States. Then
again, under date of December 12, 1801, they contented
themselves with characterizing the relations of
the two powers at this period as “<em>almost hostile</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
At an earlier day, Talleyrand, as Minister of Exterior
Relations, had written, under date of August 28, 1798:
“France has a double motive, as a nation and as a
republic, not to expose to any hazard the present
existence of the United States. Therefore it never
thought of making war against them; … <em>and every
contrary supposition is an insult to common sense</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
When the Convention, in its final form, was laid before
the Legislative Assembly, one of the French plenipotentiaries
charged with its vindication announced in a
speech, November 26, 1801, that “it had terminated
<em>the misunderstanding</em> between France and America,”
which, he said, had become such “that it was necessary
the reconciliation should be hastened, if it was
desired that it <em>should not become very difficult</em>.” A
report was also made to the Legislative Assembly by
M. Adet, formerly French minister to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
States, in which it is declared: “<em>There had not been
any declaration of war</em>. Commissions granted by the
President to attack the armed vessels of France are
not to be regarded as a declaration of war. The will
of the President does not suffice to put America in a
state of war. In order to this a positive declaration
of Congress is requisite. <em>None has ever existed.</em>”
And these legislative documents, so positive in character,
are introduced by the learned editor in words
which fitly characterize the international relations to
which they refer, when he says that “they will serve
to make known the causes which <em>momentarily disturbed
the harmony</em> of the two states.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> True enough.
Unhappily, the harmony of the two states was disturbed,
but war did not exist.</p>

<p>3. The terms of the Convention, and the final conditions
of ratification, also, exclude the idea of war. Although
beginning with a declaration that “there shall
be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace,” borrowed, in
precise words, from Mr. Jay’s treaty with Great Britain,
the Convention of 1800 did not purport to be a
treaty of peace; nor, indeed, as first executed, did it
pretend to settle the questions between the two powers,
except by postponing them to “a convenient time.”
A war annulling claims could not be treated in this
way. The American Senate admitted as much, when
it limited the duration of the Convention to eight years,
which, had war previously existed, would have turned
the Convention into a truce. The First Consul confessed
the same, when he added his far-reaching proviso,
for which, of course, there would have been no
occasion, if the claims of American citizens had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
annulled by war; and again he testified, in his words
at St. Helena, where he speaks of this Convention
as having “annulled the <em>just claims</em> which America
might have made for <em>injuries done in time of peace</em>.”
Thus falls the objection, so often urged, founded on
the alleged existence of war. Strange, that, while so
utterly untenable, it should gain a single supporter!
There is one remark which belongs to the close of this
topic. Even if France had affirmed that war existed,
yet the United States constantly denied it at the time,
both by legislative and executive acts; so that our Government
is obviously estopped against its recognition,
even if it fails to feel the indecency of such an excuse
for any further denial of justice.</p>


<h4>II.&mdash;THESE CLAIMS NOT EMBRACED IN THE LOUISIANA
CONVENTION.</h4>

<p>The objection that these claims were provided for in
the Convention of 1803, for the purchase of Louisiana,
is equally groundless. It is difficult to understand how
such a pretext was ever made; but the history of this
question shows the strange shifts of opposition, especially
when without restraint from knowledge of the
subject. The most superficial glance shows that the
two Conventions related to two different classes of
claims. Those abandoned in 1800 were on account of
spoliations, and in the nature of “torts.” Those protected
in 1803 were “debts.” When it is considered
how steadfastly the French plenipotentiaries in 1800
opposed the recognition of the claim for “torts,” and
how the First Consul, by his positive proviso, required
their renunciation, it is most unreasonable to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that in 1803 they were formally recognized. This assumption
becomes still more unreasonable, when it is
understood that only at a comparatively recent period
was the idea first broached; that it is without support
in the documentary history of the Convention, or in
any contemporary opinion; that it escaped the attention
of the Board of Commissioners appointed under
the Convention, as it escaped the attention of successive
Secretaries of State, and also of Congressional Committees,
reporting on the subject, until thus tardily it
was brought forward as a last resort of opposition.</p>

<p>The Convention of 1800, which sacrificed the claim
for “torts,” kept alive certain pending claims for
“debts.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The <em>debts contracted</em> by one of the two nations
with individuals of the other, or by the individuals of one
with the individuals of the other, <em>shall be paid</em>, or the payment
may be prosecuted, in the same manner as if there
had been no misunderstanding between the two states.
<em>But this clause shall not extend to indemnities claimed on
account of captures or confiscation.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed how carefully the claims for spoliation
were excluded from the benefit of this provision,
which is limited positively to “debts.” Though
apparently plain, the French Government found difficulties
in its execution. Vexatious delays were interposed,
and “debts” were treated little better than
“claims,” so that our minister at Paris, Hon. Robert R.
Livingston, was constrained to address the French Government,
under date of March 25, 1802:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> “The fifth article
of the treaty says, expressly, they shall be paid;
but justice and good faith say it, independent of the
treaty. Yet they remain unsatisfied; nor is the most
distant hope as yet afforded them of when or how they
will be paid.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Such was the spirit of other correspondence.
At last, by one and the same transaction,
Louisiana was purchased, and these “debts” were provided
for. The plenipotentiaries of the United States,
Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe,&mdash;the latter for a second
time plenipotentiary,&mdash;undertook to pay eighty
millions of francs for the purchase, of which sixty
millions were for France, and the remaining twenty
millions for the payment of “debts” secured by the
Convention of 1800; and these terms were embodied
in a treaty and two associate conventions of the same
date.</p>

<p>The treaty contained the terms of cession. One of
the conventions regulated the terms of purchase, and
the other provided that “<em>the debts</em> due by France to
citizens of the United States, <em>contracted before the 30th
September, 1800</em>, shall be paid” according to certain
regulations. It will be observed that these words descriptive
of the “debts” are not unlike those employed
in the fifth article of the Convention of 30th September,
1800.</p>

<p>The new Convention regulating the payment of
“debts” begins with a preamble, setting forth the
desire of the President and of the First Consul, “<em>in
compliance with the second and fifth articles</em> of the
Convention of the 30th September, 1800, to secure the
payment of the sum due by France to the citizens
of the United States.” From the association of these
two articles some hastily infer a purpose to revive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the “claims” abandoned in the famous second article.
But such revival, instead of being “in compliance”
with that article, or, according to the corresponding
French words of the Convention, <i>en exécution</i>
of that article, would be in direct contradiction
of it. The allusion to the second article is obviously
to carry into the Louisiana Convention the original
exclusion of the spoliation “claims.” If any doubt
could arise on this allusion, taken by itself, it would
disappear, when we consider that the fifth article is
both <em>inclusive</em> and <em>exclusive</em>. It includes “debts contracted,”
which are to be paid, and it excludes “indemnities
claimed on account of captures or confiscations,”
which are not to be paid. Thus the language
of the preamble is justified, and the Convention
is <em>in compliance</em> with both the second and fifth
articles of the original Convention.</p>

<p>If we examine the Louisiana Convention carefully,
we find that “debts” alone are provided for. The first
article, as we have already seen, declares, “<em>the debts</em>
due by France to citizens of the United States, contracted
before the 30th September, 1800, shall be paid
according to the following regulations.” The second
article describes “<em>the debts</em> provided for by the preceding
article” as comprised in a conjectural note.
The third article declares how “the said debts shall
be discharged by the United States.” The fourth article
more specifically defines <em>the debts</em> as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> “It
is expressly agreed that the preceding articles shall
comprehend <em>no debts</em> but such as are due to citizens
of the United States who have been and are yet creditors
of France, for <em>supplies</em>, for <em>embargoes</em>, and <em>prizes
made at sea</em> in which the appeal has been properly
lodged within the time mentioned in the said Convention,
30th September, 1800.” The fifth article explains
further the prizes intended in the fourth article,
as follows: “The preceding articles shall apply only,
1st, to captures of which the Council of Prizes shall
have ordered restitution, it being well understood that
the claimant cannot have recourse to the United States
otherwise than he might have had to the Government
of the French Republic, and only in case of insufficiency
of the captors; 2d, <em>the debts</em> mentioned in the
said fifth article of the Convention of 1800, the payment
of which has been heretofore claimed of the actual
Government of France, and for which the creditors
have a right to the protection of the United States.
The said fifth article does not comprehend prizes whose
condemnation has been or shall be confirmed.” Under
the first head, the class of captures is here defined.
It was those only where the Council of Prizes had ordered
restitution, being captures not warranted by the
laws of France. Such cases were included among
“debts,” because the decree of the Council of Prizes
ordering restitution instantly created, on the part of
the owner, a claim on the captor for the property or
its value; and where the captor was “insufficient,” the
Government assumed the debt. <em>And this is the only
class of captures provided for in the Louisiana Convention</em>.
Under the second head are specified “<em>the debts</em>
mentioned in the fifth article,” with an express declaration
that it “does not comprehend prizes whose condemnation
has been or shall be confirmed.” Thus in
every article and at every stage the spoliation claims
are excluded from the benefit of the Louisiana Convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the contemporary conclusion of our minister
at Paris, Mr. Livingston, who, in his letter to the
French Government of April 17, 1802, said: “The fifth
article expressly stipulates that <em>all debts</em> due by either
Government to the individuals of the other shall be
paid. But as this would also have included <em>the indemnities
for captures and condemnations previously
made</em>, and it was the intention of the contracting parties,
by the second article, to preclude this payment, as
depending on a future negotiation, <em>it was necessary to
except from this promise of payment all that made the
subject of the second article</em>: … as to the payment
of indemnities for embargoes in consequence of the
cargoes being put in requisition, or with a view to
any other political measure which carried with it nothing
hostile to the United States, no controversy ever
arose between the plenipotentiaries of the two nations.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Surely this objection may be dismissed.</p>


<h4>III.&mdash;THESE CLAIMS NOT EMBRACED IN THE CONVENTION
OF 1831 WITH FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Another objection has been started, kindred to the
last, also in kindred ignorance. It is said that these
claims were embraced in the later Convention of 1831
with France, under Louis Philippe. No mistake can
be greater.</p>

<p>That Convention opens with these words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> “The
French Government, <em>in order to liberate itself completely
from all the reclamations preferred against it by citizens
of the United States</em> for unlawful seizures, captures,
sequestrations, confiscations, or destructions of their vessels,
cargoes, or other property, engages to pay a sum
of twenty-five millions of francs to the Government
of the United States, who shall distribute it <em>among
those entitled</em>, in the manner and according to the rules
which it shall determine.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>This provision must be interpreted in the light of
preceding treaties, especially of that which had occupied
so much attention. They are all <i>in pari materia</i>,
and therefore, according to a familiar rule of jurisprudence,
must be taken together. But the Convention of
1800, by the proviso of the First Consul at its ratification,
<em>liberated France completely</em> from all liability for
the claims now in question, so that they ceased to be
valid against her. Therefore these claimants could not
be “among those <em>entitled</em>” under the later Convention.
This interpretation is confirmed by the judgment of
the French Government, and also by the judgment
of our own Commissioners under the Convention. Mr.
Rives, our minister at Paris, writing to Mr. Van Buren,
the Secretary of State at the time, under date of February
18, 1831, says: “From what I have been able to
learn of &mdash;&mdash;’s report, it is favorable throughout to
the principle of our claims. It excludes, however, the
claims of American citizens in the nature of debt or
of supplies, as being alien to the general scope of the
controversy between the two Governments,&mdash;and also
American claims of every description originating previous
to the date of the Louisiana arrangement, in 1803,
which has been invariably alleged by this Government
to be in full satisfaction of all claims then existing.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Our own Commissioners, sitting at Washington, reported
to the Secretary of State, under date of December
30, 1835, that they had required every person seeking
<em>to entitle</em> himself under the Convention to show that
his “claim remained unimpaired and in full force against
France at the date of the Convention of 1831.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> But
the claims in question did not come within this category.
Clearly, they were not “unimpaired and in full
force against France.”</p>

<p>All this is apparent on the face; but it was demonstrated
by the action of the Commissioners. The experiment
was made with regard to captures prior to
the ratification of the Convention of 1800, and no less
than one hundred and four cases were submitted to
the board. All but four were rejected. The first rejections,
in point of time, were January 11, 1833, in
two different cases, when we have the following entries:
“Caroline, captured February 10, 1798,&mdash;rejected,&mdash;<em>the
vessel having been captured before the 30th September,
1800</em>”; “Brig Orlando, captured March 1, 1800,&mdash;rejected,&mdash;<em>the
capture having been made anterior to the
30th September, 1800</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The indemnities allowed by
the Commissioners were mainly for captures under the
decrees of Berlin, Milan, Rambouillet, and Trianon,&mdash;that
succession of sweeping edicts by which Napoleon
at the height of power enforced his Continental system.
There were four awards for captures after the
signature of the Convention of 1800, and before its
ratification. As such cases, occurring during this intermediate
period, were plainly saved from the renunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of the Convention of 1800,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and yet were not
included in the Convention of 1803, they came naturally
within the scope of the Convention of 1831. The
claims in question had no such advantage. Renounced
in 1800, they were not adopted in 1831. But, ceasing
to be claims upon France, they have become claims
upon the United States.</p>


<h4>IV.&mdash;THESE CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY THE ACT OF
CONGRESS ANNULLING THE FRENCH TREATIES.</h4>

<p>Then it is said that the French treaties were annulled
by Act of Congress, so as to render the set-off
and mutual release a mere form, and nothing else.
This objection, also, proceeds in ignorance of the question.</p>

<p>It is true, the United States, by Act of Congress, July
7, 1798, declared the treaties heretofore concluded with
France <em>no longer obligatory</em>.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> But the question still
remained as to the effect of this Act. Not purporting
to be retrospective, all obligations under the treaties
at that date were fixed, whether on the part of the
United States or on the part of France. Therefore
France, besides constant liability under the Law of
Nations, was liable also under the treaties for all depredations
anterior to this date, and the United States
were liable for all non-performance of obligations anterior
to this date. Assuming that the treaties were annulled,
it is evident that the anterior claims of each
were not in any way affected; so that there was still,
even under the treaties, occasion for set-off and mutual
release.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The depredations upon our commerce were not merely
in violation of ancient treaties, but also of the Law
of Nations; so that, even if the treaties were annulled,
yet the Law of Nations remained with its obligations
and remedies. Our plenipotentiaries were instructed
to obtain compensation for captures and condemnations
contrary to the Law of Nations generally received
in Europe, or to stipulations of treaty, so long as the
latter “remained in force.” As the treaties “remained
in force” until July 7, 1798, we were unquestionably
liable to France for indemnities to that day. Before
that day the West India islands were lost. Before
that day we excluded French privateers and their
prizes from our ports. All proper damages for these
things must have entered into the French account
against us. Therefore the annulling Act of Congress
could affect only the <i>quantum</i> of consideration on both
sides at the set-off and mutual release, and not the
fact of consideration.</p>

<p>But it is more than doubtful if the annulling Act
could have the effect attributed to it. Can one of
two parties render a contract void by mere declaration
to that effect? Between two individuals this cannot
be done. Could it be done between two nations?
Mr. Jefferson thought not. At least, there is a report
from him on another occasion completely covering this
case. These are his words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> “It is desirable in many
instances to exchange mutual advantages by legislative
acts rather than by treaty; because the former,
though understood to be in consideration of each other,
and therefore greatly respected, yet, when they become
too inconvenient, can be dropped at the will of either
party; <em>whereas stipulations by treaty are forever irrevocable
but by joint consent, let a change of circumstances
render them ever so burdensome</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Chief Justice Marshall
quotes another opinion, where a treaty was declared
to be not only the law of the land, but a law
of a superior order, “because it not only repeals past
laws, <em>but cannot itself be repealed by future ones</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Such authority would seem to settle this question, especially
reinforced as it is by the Law of Nations; for
it must not be forgotten that the obligation of treaties
is determined by International Law rather than by
Municipal Law.</p>

<p>Even supposing the Act of Congress had succeeded
in annulling the treaties, its effect, as regards France,
was not so much to discharge her claims as to make
them perfect. In plain terms, it was a final determination
on our part not to fulfil the treaties. The circumstances
of the time, perhaps, rendered it necessary;
but your Committee cannot fail to observe, that, according
to all principles of justice and the established
usage of nations, this very determination consummated
the right of France to indemnities for non-observance
of the treaties. On our part there was no longer any
pretence to fulfil the treaties; so that this very Act of
Congress, which is cited to excuse us, may be cited to
condemn us.</p>

<p>Whatever the law of this case, even assuming, that,
according to good opinions, the treaties were annulled
on the 7th July, 1798, it is perfectly clear that at the
negotiation of 1800 they were treated by France as
obligatory. On these she founded her counter-claims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The present narrative shows her persistency. As often
as our claims were urged, her counter-claims were
pressed in reply. And why ask the renunciation of
the treaties, if the Act of Congress had already annulled
them? Why, further, offer a large sum of
money for release from their obligations? Whatever
the effect of the annulling Act in the judgment of the
American plenipotentiaries, it is clear that they regarded
the treaties as a cloud to be removed. And it
is equally clear that the French plenipotentiaries to
the last maintained the obligations of the treaties. The
instructions of the First Consul, before entering upon
his Italian campaign, were to make “the acknowledgment
of former treaties the basis of negotiation and
the condition of compensation.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It was the finality
of these instructions which at the time caused the
dead-lock already described. Thus, on the part of the
United States, the obligation of the treaties was denied
subsequently to July 7, 1798, while on the part of
France it was affirmed as an indispensable condition
down to the negotiation.</p>

<p>Therefore, on the part of the United States, there
were claims under the treaties anterior to July 7, 1798,
and also under the Law of Nations generally. On the
part of France there were counter-claims under the
treaties down to the negotiation. Each side was tenacious.
Neither would yield. The time for compromise
arrived. Then came the set-off and mutual release.
The transaction was between two nations, but it was
identical in character with transactions often occurring
between two individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>


<h4>V.&mdash;EARLY PERSISTENCY TO SECURE INDEMNITIES FROM
FRANCE NO GROUND OF EXEMPTION FROM PRESENT
LIABILITY.</h4>

<p>The persistent efforts of our Government, anterior
to the Convention of 1800, are sometimes brought forward
as sufficient reason for present indifference. This
also is a mistake.</p>

<p>It is true that our Government exerted itself much.
Considering its comparative immaturity, it deserves
credit for the courage and determination with which it
labored. But it must not be forgotten that in all it
did, even for the recovery of indemnities, it acted under
the duties and instincts of national defence. Our
commerce was despoiled, to the detriment of American
citizens. But this grievance, which went on assuming
larger proportions, proceeded directly from the
<em>hostile spirit</em> of France, aroused by alleged infraction
of national obligations on our part; so that behind
the question of indemnities rose always the question
of self-defence. France made reprisals because the
United States refused compliance with solemn treaties,
and, as is usual in such cases, individual citizens were
the sufferers. Defending the interests of its citizens,
the country itself was defended. To abandon these
interests, especially without securing an abandonment
of French pretensions, would have been an abandonment
of the country, leaving it the dishonored victim
of untold exactions without end. If this be correct,&mdash;and
your Committee do not see how it can be controverted,&mdash;there
can be no boast of extraordinary
efforts, all of which, whatever form they assumed, were
in the performance of a patriotic duty, simple as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
filial devotion of Cordelia, “according to her bond, nor
more nor less.”</p>

<p>And now the fidelity of that early day, when duty
was done, is the apology for infidelity to-day, when
duty is left undone; and those patriotic efforts are
vouched as a title to present exemption. Because
the Government was zealous for indemnities when
France was responsible, <em>argal</em> it may be indifferent
now, when the United States are substituted for France.
Or has it come to this,&mdash;that it is right to be zealous
in pressing a foreign Government, but not right to
be zealous against ourselves, <em>when substituted for that
foreign Government</em>, as in the present case? Beyond
the misconception of public duty apparent in this pretence,
it forgets the true state of the question. Here,
again, we are brought to the Convention of 1800, when
both claims and counter-claims were adjusted. If the
claims on our side had been deliberately rejected, or
if our Government had been compelled to withdraw,
as in a case of nonsuit, the case might have been otherwise.
There was no rejection, and no nonsuit, but, as
has been so fully shown, a set-off and mutual release,
by which each party accorded to its adversary just as
much as it claimed for itself. So far as the two Governments
were concerned, claims and counter-claims
were extinguished, and neither could look to the other;
but it did not follow that American citizens, whose “individual”
claims had been appropriated to extinguish
“national” obligations, were cut off from appeal to their
own Government. On the contrary, the very zeal for
these claimants, while they looked to France, is still
due in their behalf, now that, by the action of their
own Government, they must look to their country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>It is sometimes said in sarcasm that it is easy to be
generous at the expense of another; but in this case,
now that the responsibility has been transferred to our
own country, it is not a question of generosity, but of
debt. The property of these claimants is actually in
the hands of our Government, like assets paid over
and deposited “for whomsoever it may concern,”&mdash;or,
to use a more pungent illustration, like certain property
to which there can be no valid title against the
original owner. Stolen goods may be followed wherever
found. But the vessels of these claimants were
stolen by France, and at last are found in the hands
of our own Government. Will the Government hold
them against the real owners? For nearly ten years
it denounced the conduct of France. How, then, can
it profit by this conduct at the expense of its own
citizens? If the receiver is as bad as the original
offender, how can the Government expect to escape
the indignant condemnation it fastened upon France?
Least of all, how can any early persistency to recover
this property excuse its detention now?</p>


<h4>VI.&mdash;THESE CLAIMS NEVER DESPERATE, SO AS TO BE
OF NO VALUE.</h4>

<p>Kindred to the last objection is the assertion that
the claims were intrinsically desperate, so as to be of
no value,&mdash;an objection as humiliating as false.</p>

<p>It is humiliating, because it assumes that claims
solemnly declared just, both by the executive and
legislative branches,&mdash;the former by successive acts
of diplomacy, and the latter by successive Acts of
Congress,&mdash;were of “no value.” If this were true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
then was our Government, when it sued these claims,
guilty of national <em>barratry</em>, for which it would deserve
to be thrown over the bar of nations. It was
a stirrer of false suits. Such an imputation is an impeachment
of the national character.</p>

<p>But it is false. The claims were never “desperate,”
except so far as they were doomed to meet the
counter-claims of France. On the contrary, they were
intrinsically just, and their justice was often admitted
even by France, who advanced against them her own
pretensions under the treaties. And when the set-off
and mutual release occurred, their validity was solemnly
recognized; nay, more, they were paid to the
United States. Such is the inconsistency of objectors,
insisting that claims thus recognized and paid were
so far “desperate” as to be of “no value,” when they
were of sufficient value to form the sole consideration
of release from immeasurable national obligations. If
you would find a measure of value for the American
claims, you must look to the counter-claims of France,
not forgetting that all the vehemence with which these
were sustained testifies unmistakably to our claims.</p>

<p>If we may judge from our national history, there is
no reason to doubt that these claims, if not released
by our Government, would have been fully satisfied by
France afterwards. It is in the nature of claims on
foreign powers to seem desperate. Such was the case,
as is well remembered, with the claims on Denmark,
on Spain, and on Naples; but all these have been paid.
<em>No just claim by the American Government can be desperate.</em>
What claims could seem more desperate than
those under the arbitrary, wide-spreading edicts of Napoleon
Bonaparte in his pride of place? But President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Jackson, when Louis Philippe had become King,
made an appeal, as he expressed it, “to the justice and
magnanimity of regenerated France,”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and even these
claims, accruing under a Government which had ceased
to exist, were satisfied. The claims in question had as
much intrinsic equity, and were more intimately associated
with the national sentiments. Asserting that
they would have been paid, the Committee are sustained
not only by the reason of the case, but by the
judgment of the disinterested historian of our country,
who thus concludes his account of the Convention
of 1800, and its final ratification with the proviso of
the First Consul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Had the treaty been ratified in its original shape, the
sufferers by the spoliations of the French might, perhaps,
before now, have obtained that indemnity from the French
Government which they have ever since been asking of
their own, but which has hitherto been unjustly withheld.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is no statute of limitations between nations;
so that these claims would have been as valid against
France in 1831 as they unquestionably were in 1800.
A nation like the United States has only “to bide its
time,” and the day of justice will come. Indeed, President
Jackson, when dwelling on the negotiations with
France in 1831, bore testimony to the vitality of American
claims on foreign powers, when he said that the
new Convention would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> “an encouragement for perseverance
in the demands of justice, by this new proof,
that, if steadily pursued, they will be listened to, and admonition
will be offered to those powers, if any, which
may be inclined to evade them, <em>that they will never be
abandoned</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> These words of Andrew Jackson are a
sufficient answer to the present objection.</p>


<h3>ALL OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</h3>

<p>Such are the objections to the responsibility of the
United States. The Committee believe that they have
all been answered, so that the claims stand above impeachment
or question, as a debt to be liquidated and
paid. It only remains to consider what sum should be
appropriated for this purpose.</p>


<h3>JUST COMPENSATION.</h3>

<p>The “just compensation” to be paid by the United
States may be regarded, according to the classical report
of Mr. Livingston, in two lights: <i>first</i>, the value of the
advantages to the United States at the expense of these
claimants; and, <i>secondly</i>, the actual losses sustained by
these claimants. Neither is proposed as an absolute
measure. A glance at each will enable us to arrive, by
approximation, at a proper result.</p>


<h3>VALUE OF ADVANTAGES TO THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to estimate in money the advantages
to the United States. Beyond the great boon of
assured peace, under which our commerce, no longer
exposed to spoliation, put forth at once more than its
original life, two specific objects were gained: <i>first</i>,
exemption from all outstanding engagements and liabilities
of every nature under the early treaties with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
France; and, <i>secondly</i>, the establishment of a new Convention,
which, while rejecting much-debated claims
and counter-claims, provided positive advantages to
the United States, among which was that payment of
“debts” subsequently assured by the Louisiana Convention.</p>

<p>If the United States could be held responsible to
France for the treasure lavished on national independence,
in pursuance of these original treaties, there
would be an item of fourteen hundred and forty millions
of francs, or about two hundred and eighty millions
of dollars.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The brave lives sacrificed for us cannot
be estimated in any account; but France did not
forget them. Even amidst the congratulations at Morfontaine
in honor of the Convention, the First Consul
reminded the joyous company of the sacrifice. Beyond
the toast he proposed in honor of those who fell in
battle for the independence of the New World, there
is no record of what was said by the successful general
of France; but old Homer, in one of his most touching
passages, had already spoken for him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold;</div>
<div class="verse">Not all Apollo’s Pythian treasures hold,</div>
<div class="verse">Or Troy once held in peace and pride of sway,</div>
<div class="verse">Can bribe the poor possession of a day.</div>
<div class="verse">Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,</div>
<div class="verse">And steeds unrivalled on the dusty plain;</div>
<div class="verse">But from our lips the vital spirit fled</div>
<div class="verse">Returns no more to wake the silent dead.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the sod of America, and under the waves of
the Atlantic, Frenchmen were sleeping whose lives had
been given to the support of our cause. If France did
not forget them, let it be spoken in her honor; but we
cannot forget them, as we try to state the great account
between our two countries. Their swords, if flung into
the scales, whatever “heaps of gold” we might bring,
would forever turn the balance against us.</p>

<p>But how estimate the value of release from the
“guaranty” retrospectively and prospectively, as well
for past failures as future liabilities? It was often
urged that the guaranty bound the United States to
the support of France only in the event of a defensive
war, and that the war in which she had been
engaged was not of this character. But it is more
than doubtful if either proposition can be maintained.
The guaranty on its face has no limitation. And even
if it had such limitation, who will venture to say that
the war in which France drove back her multitudinous
assailants, reinforced by the navies of England,
was not defensive? If France did not at once require
the execution of the guaranty, it was none the less a
vital obligation.</p>

<p>That our Government appreciated the embarrassments,
if not the obligations, which the guaranty entailed,
has already been shown by the Committee.
But there are certain words that may be fitly quoted
again. In the instructions of our Secretary of State
to the first triumvirate of plenipotentiaries at Paris,
under date of July 15, 1797, it is admitted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> “our
guaranty of the possessions of France in America will
perpetually expose us to the risk and expense of war,
or to disputes and questions concerning our national
faith.” On this account the plenipotentiaries were instructed
to obtain its release, and “on the part of the
United States, instead of troops or ships of war, to stipulate
for a moderate sum of money or quantity of provisions,
at the option of France, … not to exceed
two hundred thousand dollars a year.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> This was
moderate; but it was a recognition of the guaranty,
and of its practical value. The next triumvirate, at
the negotiation of 1800, offered more. They proposed
to buy out the guaranty by a payment of five millions
of francs, or one million of dollars.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> It is needless
to say that both these offers were rejected.</p>

<p>It would be as difficult to measure in money the
value of that guaranty, retrospectively and prospectively,
as to measure in money our obligations to France
in the assurance of national independence. The liabilities
for failure prior to 1800, if pressed, would not
have been inconsiderable. But had the guaranty continued
so as to constrain the United States throughout
the long war that followed, ending at Waterloo, what
arithmetic can calculate the damage? Nay, more,&mdash;if,
at the present moment, any such guaranty bound
us to France, who would not feel that it was an obligation
from which we must be released at any price?</p>

<p>Besides the obligations of “guaranty,” were other engagements
with regard to French armed ships in our
ports which had proved most onerous. Here, also, was
alleged failure on our part; and there was the prospect
of infinite embarrassment, if not of open war, unless
these obligations were cancelled. To keep them
would cause collision with England; not to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
would cause collision with France. Our plenipotentiaries
offered, in the negotiation of 1800, three millions of
francs for release from these obligations.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> This moderate
offer was rejected also.</p>

<p>France continued stubborn, insisting upon the ancient
treaties, with all consequent indemnities. At last,
by the propositions of the 4th of September, 1800, already
exhibited by your Committee, a measure of value
was affixed to our engagements and liabilities. France
undertook to release us from all these on condition that
we would pay the indemnities due to our citizens, thus
treating claims and counter-claims as equivalent in value.
It was required positively that “the indemnities
which shall be due by France to the citizens of the
United States <em>shall be paid for by the United States</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
In consideration of release from the treaties, the United
States were to assume the obligations of France to
American claimants. How this proposition, rejected
at first, eventually prevailed in the Convention and
its successive amendments has been already explained.
It is mentioned now only to show the value of these
engagements and liabilities.</p>


<h3>ACTUAL LOSSES TO CLAIMANTS.</h3>

<p>The practical question remains, as to the actual losses
of the claimants. Here the evidence is precise and
full.</p>

<p>Our own Government, when pressing these claims
upon France, gave an official estimate of their value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
On one occasion it put them above fifteen million
dollars.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Afterward it put them at twenty million
dollars. The latter estimate is found in a report from
the Secretary of State to Congress, under date of
January 18, 1799, where it speaks of “unjust and
cruel depredations on American commerce, which have
brought distress on multitudes and ruin on many of
our citizens, and occasioned <em>a total loss of property
to the United States of probably more than twenty millions
of dollars</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Inquiry into the losses confirms
this statement. From evidence presented to committees
in former years, and now belonging to history, it
has been estimated that there were <em>eight hundred and
ninety-eight vessels</em> included in the claims released to
France.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The American vessels despoiled by France between
1792, the outbreak of the European war, and July 31,
1801, when the Convention of 1800, with its proviso,
was ratified by Napoleon Bonaparte, have been reckoned
at two thousand two hundred and ninety, embracing
as follows: first, vessels captured by the French;
secondly, vessels captured by the French and Spaniards
conjointly; thirdly, vessels detained by embargo
at Bordeaux. The following list shows how the account
stands.</p>

<p>Thus we are brought to the number of <em>eight hundred

<p>To arrive at the value of these vessels, the Committee
have been led to look at the estimate of vessels
under conventions with other powers for the payment
of similar claims. Here is a list allowed by different

<p>From this list it appears that Mexico has paid as
high an average as $31,000 for each vessel; Naples,
$37,000; and Great Britain, $47,000. The general
average of the whole list is $19,000.</p>

<p>If the vessels despoiled by France were estimated
according to the highest average, namely, that of vessels
despoiled by Great Britain, the sum-total would
swell to no less than $42,206,000; estimated according
to the general average, the amount is $17,062,000.</p>

<p>But the valuation which has been deemed most satisfactory
is that presented in the indemnity paid by
Spain for the French spoliations on our commerce in
her ports during this period, amounting, for 173 vessels,
to $2,845,619, being an average of $16,500 for each
vessel. Adopting this average, we have as the aggregate
value of the 898 vessels yielded to France under
the Convention of 1800, and lost to our merchants, the
sum of $14,817,000,&mdash;nearly <em>fifteen million dollars</em>.</p>

<p>This estimate, tested by the official statements, fixing
the spoliations in October, 1797, at fifteen millions, and
in January, 1799, at twenty millions, will appear at
least not excessive,&mdash;adding for the continued spoliations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
during the succeeding two years and a half to
July, 1801, only the very moderate allowance of two
and one half millions, (being in the ratio of but one
fourth the increase for the fifteen months between the
two former dates,) and deducting payments. Here are
the figures:&mdash;</p>

<p>If to this estimate interest be added, even at the
smallest rate, the losses of these sufferers will assume
vastly larger proportions. More than sixty years have
run their course since the United States, by a public act
and for a valuable consideration, became their debtor.
From the beginning the country has enjoyed without
price all the “national” benefits originally secured at
their expense, as part of the national capital with its
bountiful income, while these claimants have been shut
out from their property, and all its just profits. If interest
be due on any national debt, it is difficult to see
why it is not due here.</p>

<p>Never was a case stronger. Nor is there any doubt
with regard to the rule. According to the best authorities,
whether publicists or courts, interest is justly due.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Though swelling the national liability, it is none the
less an item in the case.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that these claims are under
the Law of Nations. As such, the rule of damages is
under that law, and not Municipal Law. Therefore the
Committee resort to the Law of Nations. Among all
the authorities, none has spoken more fully and clearly
than Rutherforth; nor is there any one whose words
on this point are oftener cited. Here is the rule:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In estimating the damages which any one has sustained,
where such things as he has a perfect right to are unjustly
taken from him, or withholden, or intercepted, we are to consider
not only the value of the thing itself, but the value likewise
of the fruits or profits that might have arisen from it.
He who is the owner of the thing is likewise the owner of
such fruits or profits. So that it is as properly a damage to be
deprived of them as it is to be deprived of the thing itself.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Grotius says substantially the same.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> So does Vattel,
who declares that claimants may obtain “what is due,
<em>together with interest and damages</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> And Wheaton
copies Vattel.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The Supreme Court of the United States
gives the same rule with nearly equal simplicity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The prime cost, or value of the property lost at the time
of the loss, and, in case of injury, the diminution in value
by reason of the injury, <em>with interest upon such valuation</em>,
affords the true measure for assessing damages.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the law of interest, and the Committee refer
to it as illustrating the accumulated losses which await
satisfaction at the hands of Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>


<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p>The Committee, impressed by the original justice of
these claims and the present obligation of the United
States, do not hesitate to recommend their liquidation
and payment at an early day, as they would recommend
the discharge of a national debt. While setting forth
the unanswerable evidence of their value, they content
themselves with the recommendation made many years
ago, and repeated by successive committees of both
Houses of Congress, limiting the appropriation to a sum
not exceeding five million dollars, without interest, to
be distributed by a board of commissioners <i>pro rata</i>
among the claimants, according to the provisions of the
bill reported herewith. The limitation is a departure
from strict justice, but it is part of the additional sacrifice
which seems to be expected by Congress from these
long-suffering claimants.</p>

<p>In deference to the Secretary of the Treasury,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> who,
when consulted thereupon, objected to the creation of
a stock for this special purpose, as provided in former
bills, it is proposed that the money be paid whenever
Congress shall make an appropriation therefor.</p>

<p>By positive description the bill is made to cover
claims for illegal captures and condemnations prior to
July 31, 1801, the date of the final ratification of the
Convention. But, by positive words of exclusion, it is
provided that the bill shall not cover claims originally
embraced in the Louisiana Convention of 1803, in the
treaty with Spain of 22d February, 1819, or in the Convention
with France of July 4, 1831; so that, in point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of fact, the bill is carefully limited to those original
claims which, after postponement by the second article
of the Convention of 1800, were, at its final ratification,
definitely renounced by the United States, in consideration
of equivalent renunciations from France.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>The Committee have now finished the review which,
in the discharge of public service, they were called to
make. Approaching a much vexed question without
prejudice, they have striven to consider it with candor,
in the hope of ascertaining and exhibiting the requirements
of duty. The conclusion they have adopted, in
harmony with so many previous committees of both
houses, and also with Congress itself, which has twice
enacted a law for the satisfaction of these claims, is now
submitted to the judgment of the Senate.</p>

<p>How the Committee have reached this conclusion
is seen by a final glance at the field that has been
traversed. Putting aside the three preliminary objections
to these claims,&mdash;(1.) that they are ancient and
stale, (2.) that they have passed into the hands of speculators,
and (3.) that they should be postponed on account
of the present condition of public affairs,&mdash;the
Committee have considered in order four principal topics:
<i>First</i>, the claims of American citizens on France,
as they appear in the history of the times; <i>secondly</i>,
the counter-claims of France, as they, too, appear in the
history of the times; <i>thirdly</i>, how the “individual”
claims of American citizens were sacrificed to procure
release of the “national” claims of France by a proceeding
in the nature of set-off and mutual release;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and, <i>fourthly</i>, how the United States, for a valuable
consideration, assumed the obligations of France, so as
to become completely responsible therefor. Not content
with showing affirmatively the merits of the claimants,
the Committee next examined all known objections to
the asserted responsibility of the United States, establishing
negatively: (1.) that the relations between
France and the United States were at no time such as
to constitute a state of war, invalidating the claims;
(2.) that they were not embraced in the Convention
for the purchase of Louisiana; (3.) that they were not
embraced in the later Convention of 1831; (4.) that the
alleged annulling of the French treaties by Act of Congress
did not affect them; (5.) that the early efforts of
our Government with France, for their satisfaction, furnish
no ground of exemption from present liability;
and (6.) that the claims, at the time of their abandonment,
were not desperate, so as to be without value.</p>

<p>With the removal of all known objections, the way
was open to consider the extent of “just compensation”
under three different heads: (1.) the advantages secured
to the United States by the sacrifice of these claimants;
(2.) the actual losses of these claimants; and (3.) the
final recommendations of the Committee.</p>

<p>Such is the whole case in its divisions and subdivisions.
There is one reflection which belongs naturally
to the close. These claims have survived several generations,
entwining themselves each year with the national
history. Meanwhile the Republic, for whose advantage
they were sacrificed, has outgrown the puny
condition of that early day, when its commerce was
the prey of France, and even the sacred debt for independence
was left unpaid. These claimants have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
called to remark the glorious transformation by which
the weak has become strong and the poor has become
rich; with glistening eye they have followed the flag
of the country, as it was carried successfully in every
sea; with sympathetic heart they have heard the name
of the country sounded with honor in every land; and
now they joyfully witness the unexampled resources
with which it upholds the national cause against an
unexampled rebellion;&mdash;but these claimants have been
called to observe, especially, how, for many years, unchecked
by hindrances, the National Government labored
successfully with foreign powers to secure justice
for despoiled citizens, until all nations&mdash;Great Britain,
Spain, Denmark, Naples, Holland, Mexico, Colombia,
Peru, and Chile&mdash;have yielded to persistent negotiation,
and even France has paid indemnities to our citizens
for spoliations subsequent to these very claims.
All this history these claimants have observed with
pride; but how can they forbear to exclaim at the sacrifice
required of them,&mdash;that they alone, the pioneers
of our commercial flag, are compelled “in suing long to
bide,” while part of the debt for national independence
is cast upon their shoulders, and the whole country
enjoys priceless benefits at their expense? Well may
these disappointed suitors, hurt by unfeeling indifference
to their extensive losses, and worn with endless
delay, cry out in bitterness of heart, “Give us back our
ships!” But this cannot be done. It only remains that
Congress should pay for them.</p>

<p>The Christian religion is equal in its operation, and is accommodated to
every nation on the globe. It robs no one of his freedom, violates none of

your kingdoms in the beginning of your reign, that the Almighty may make

<p>In a clause of his will Cortés expresses a doubt whether it is right to exact
personal service from the natives, and commands that a strict inquiry shall
be made into the nature and value of such services as he had received, and
that in all cases a fair compensation shall be allowed for them. Lastly, he
makes this remarkable declaration: “It has long been a question, whether
one can conscientiously hold property in Indian slaves. Since this point has
not yet been determined, I enjoin it on my son Martin and his heirs that they
spare no pains to come to an exact knowledge of the truth, as a matter
which deeply concerns the conscience of each of them, no less than mine.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cortés</span>,

<p>The first public movement for an Amendment of the National Constitution,
abolishing Slavery, was a resolution presented by the devoted
Abolitionist, Henry C. Wright, and adopted by the American Antislavery
Society at its anniversary meeting in Philadelphia, December 4,
1863. In a letter to Mr. Sumner, January 13, 1870, Mr. Wright recounted
the history of this resolution, which he set forth, prefixing
the original in the handwriting of Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the voice of the people is heard through petitions to Congress, and
this Convention earnestly recommend that this voice be raised in petitions
for an Amendment of the Constitution, declaring that Slavery shall be forever
prohibited within the limits of the United States.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner.</span></p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">On board of Steamboat Empire State.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wright adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is in your hand. On the back, in my hand, are the words: ‘Saloon
of Steamer Empire State, on Long Island Sound, Wednesday, <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, December
2, 1863. Adopted by the American Antislavery Society, at its thirtieth
anniversary or third decade meeting, held in Philadelphia, December 3d
and 4th, 1863. Adopted December 4th, Friday. Presented by Henry C.
Wright, of Boston, and adopted by the Society without a dissenting voice.’</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Henry C. Wright.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wright afterwards communicated these facts to the press.</p>

<p>December 14, 1863, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Ashley, of
Ohio, introduced a Constitutional Amendment abolishing Slavery, in
these terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slavery is hereby forever prohibited in all the States of the Union, and
in all Territories now owned or which may hereafter be acquired by the
United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the same day, Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, introduced another, in these
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slavery, being incompatible with a free Government, is forever prohibited
in the United States, and involuntary servitude shall be permitted only as a
punishment for crime.”</p>

</div>

<p>January 11, 1864, in the Senate, Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, proposed
the following amendment:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime,
shall not exist in the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p>February 8th, while the Committee had the question still under consideration,
Mr. Sumner proposed an Amendment as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article &mdash;.</span> Everywhere within the limits of the United States, and
of each State or Territory thereof, all persons are equal before the law, so
that no person can hold another as a slave.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner moved the reference of the joint resolution containing
his Amendment to the Select Committee on Slavery and Freedmen, of
which he was Chairman. Mr. Trumbull thought it had better go to
the Committee on the Judiciary, to which the other proposition had
been referred. Mr. Sumner remarked, that already petitions against
the Fugitive Slave Act had been reported from the Committee on the
Judiciary with the recommendation that they be referred to the other
Committee, that the terms of the resolution raising this Committee
were broad enough to cover every proposition relating to Slavery, and
that, in fact, petitions relating to a Constitutional Amendment had already
been referred to this Committee. If after this statement the Senator
desired that the joint resolution should be referred to the Committee
of which he was the honored head, Mr. Sumner consented with the
greatest pleasure. Mr. Trumbull expressed the opinion that “the appropriate
Committee for all propositions to change the Constitution
was the Judiciary Committee,” and in this opinion Mr. Doolittle concurred.
Mr. Sumner was perfectly willing to follow the suggestion
made. His chief desire was that the Committee would “act upon it
soon.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, moved that the joint resolution
be indefinitely postponed, which was lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 31.
It was then referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p>February 10th, Mr. Trumbull reported back the two joint resolutions,
and the various petitions on the subject, with a substitute, as an
amendment to the joint resolution of Mr. Henderson, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall
exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
legislation.”</p>

</div>

<p>February 17th, Mr. Sumner, inferring from the report of the Committee
a disposition to follow the Ordinance for the Northwest Territory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>and also thinking it desirable to expel from the Constitution
clauses alleged to concern Slavery, gave notice of the following substitute,
the first clause of which is modelled precisely on the famous prohibition
in the Ordinance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Article 13.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
anywhere in the United States, or within the jurisdiction thereof, otherwise
than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly
convicted; and the Congress may make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper to enforce this prohibition.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> In the third paragraph of the second section of the first
article, concerning the apportionment of Representatives, the following words
shall be struck out, so as to be no longer a part of the Constitution, namely:
‘Which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons,
including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians
not taxed, three fifths of all other persons,’ except the words ‘excluding Indians
not taxed,’ which shall be allowed to remain, so that the whole clause
shall read: ‘Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among
the several States which may be included within this Union according to
their respective numbers, excluding Indians not taxed.’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section 3.</span> The whole of the third paragraph of the second section of
the fourth article, in the words hereto appended, shall be struck out, so as to
be no longer a part of the Constitution, namely: ‘No person held to service
or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall,
in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such
service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom
such service or labor may be due.’”</p>

</div>

<p>March 28th, the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded
to consider the joint resolution, the pending question being the substitute
of the Committee. Mr. Trumbull opened the debate by an elaborate
speech, in which he said: “If we are to get rid of the institution
of Slavery, we must have some more efficient way of doing it than by
the Proclamations that have been issued or the Acts of Congress which
have been passed.… Sir, in my judgment, the only effectual way of
ridding the country of Slavery, and so that it cannot be resuscitated,
is by an Amendment of the Constitution, forever prohibiting it within
the jurisdiction of the United States. It is reasonable to suppose,
that, if this proposed Amendment passes Congress, it will within a
year receive the ratification of the requisite number of States to make
it a part of the Constitution. That accomplished, and we are forever
freed of this troublesome question.… We take this question entirely
away from the politics of the country; we relieve Congress of sectional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>strifes; and, what is better than all, we restore to a whole race
that freedom which is theirs by the gift of God, but which we for generations
have wickedly denied them.” Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
made an effective speech, whose character appears in its title, as published:
“The Death of Slavery is the Life of the Nation.” Then followed,
on successive days, speeches from Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, Mr.
Saulsbury, of Delaware, Mr. McDougall, of California, Mr. Hendricks,
of Indiana, and Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, all against the Amendment.
Mr. Davis declared that “the most operative single cause of the pending
war was the intermeddling of Massachusetts with the institution of
Slavery,” and it was an “objection of overruling weight, that no revision
of the Constitution, in any form, ought to be undertaken under
the auspices of the party in power.” Mr. Saulsbury said: “Immediately
after the Flood, the Almighty condemned a whole race to servitude.
He said, ‘Cursed be Canaan!’” In behalf of the Amendment
were able speeches by Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, Mr. Howe, of
Wisconsin, Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, Mr. Harlan, of Iowa,
Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Henderson, of Missouri.</p>

<p>April 8th, the last day of debate, Mr. Sumner made the speech
which follows this Introduction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the discussion there were several votes. Mr. Davis moved
as a substitute, “No negro, or person whose mother or grandmother
is or was a negro, shall be a citizen of the United States, or be eligible
to any civil or military office or to any place of trust or profit under
the United States.” This was lost,&mdash;Yeas 5, Nays 32. Mr. Davis
then proposed to add to the first section of the proposed article: “But
no slave shall be entitled to his or her freedom under this Amendment,
if resident, at the time it takes effect, in any State the laws of which
forbid free negroes to reside therein, until removed from such State by
the Government of the United States.” This was rejected without a
division. Mr. Davis further proposed to add at the end of the second
section, that, “when this Amendment of the Constitution shall have
taken effect by freeing the slaves, Congress shall provide for the distribution
and settlement of all the population of African descent in the
United States among the several States and Territories in proportion to
the white population of each State and Territory.” This also was rejected
without a division, as was another Amendment by him concerning
the election of President and Vice-President. Mr. Powell moved
to add to the first section: “No slave shall be emancipated by this
article, unless the owner thereof shall be first paid the value of the
slave or slaves so emancipated.” This was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 2, Nays
34.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Sumner offered his substitute in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another
as a slave; and the Congress may make all laws necessary and proper to
carry this article into effect everywhere within the United States and the
jurisdiction thereof.”</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the Amendment of the Committee he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It starts with the idea of reproducing the Jeffersonian Ordinance. I
doubt the expediency of reproducing that Ordinance. It performed an excellent
work in its day, but there are words in it which are entirely inapplicable
to our time. They are the limitation, ‘otherwise than in the punishment
of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.’ Now,
unless I err, there is an implication from those words that men may be
enslaved as a punishment of crimes whereof they shall have been duly convicted.
There was a reason for that at the time; for I understand that it
was the habit in certain parts of the country to doom persons as slaves
for life as a punishment for crime, and it was not proposed to prohibit this
habit. But Slavery in our day is something distinct, perfectly well known,
requiring no words of distinction outside of itself. Why, therefore, add
the words, ‘nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted’? To my mind they are
entirely surplusage. They do no good there, but absolutely introduce a
doubt.</p>

<p>“In placing a new and important text in our Constitution we cannot be
too careful. We should consider well that the language adopted in this
Chamber to-day will in all probability be adopted in the other House, and
it must be adopted, also, by three fourths of the Legislatures of the States.
Therefore we have every motive, the strongest inducement in the world, to
make that language as perfect as possible. I do not hesitate to say, that I
object to the Jeffersonian Ordinance, even if presented here in its original
text. But now I am brought to the point that the proposition of the Committee
is not the Jeffersonian Ordinance, except in its bad feature. In other
respects, it discards the language of the Jeffersonian Ordinance, and also its
collocation of words.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Trumbull replied, that the Committee, upon discussion and examination,
had come to their conclusion. “I do not know,” he said,
“that I should have adopted these precise words, but a majority of the
Committee thought they were the best words; they accomplish the
object; and I cannot see why the Senator from Massachusetts should
be so pertinacious about particular words.” He hoped Mr. Sumner
would withdraw his proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard, of Michigan, wished as much as Mr. Sumner to use
significant language that cannot be mistaken or misunderstood; but
he preferred to dismiss all reference to French constitutions or French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>codes, and “go back to the good old Anglo-Saxon language employed
by our fathers in the Ordinance of 1787, an expression which has been
adjudicated upon repeatedly, which is perfectly well understood both
by the public and by judicial tribunals.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner withdrew his proposition, which he called a “suggestion”
only, and also “a sincere effort to contribute as much as he could
to improve the proposition in form,” but could not resist the appeal
of his friend, the Chairman of the Committee. He forbore to press
any amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner often regretted that he had not insisted upon a vote on
striking out the clause giving implied sanction to slavery or involuntary
servitude as “a punishment for crime.”</p>

<p>April 8th, on the passage of the joint resolution, the vote stood, Yeas
38, Nays 6, when the Vice-President announced that the joint resolution,
having received the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators
present, was passed.</p>

<p>May 31st, the joint resolution was taken up in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Holman, of Indiana, objected to its second reading,
and the Speaker stated the question, “Shall the joint resolution be
rejected?” On this question the vote stood, Yeas 55, Nays 76; and
the joint resolution was not rejected. An excited debate occupied several
days.</p>

<p>June 15th, the vote was taken, and it stood, Yeas 95, Nays 66, not
voting 21. So the joint resolution failed, two thirds not voting in
its favor. Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, a most strenuous supporter of the Constitutional
Amendment, changed his vote from the affirmative to the
negative, so as to move a reconsideration, which motion he made in the
evening, and it was duly entered on the Journal, thus holding the
joint resolution in suspense. The session of Congress closed without
further action.</p>

<p>At the next session the President in his Annual Message reminded
Congress of the pending Constitutional Amendment, and recommended
its “reconsideration and passage,” adding, that by the recent election
the will of the majority was “most clearly declared in favor of such
Constitutional Amendment.” January 6, 1865, on motion of Mr. Ashley,
the House of Representatives took up his motion to reconsider the
vote of rejection. The debate, which was opened by him in an earnest
speech, proceeded, with some interruptions, until January 31st, when
he called the previous question on the motion. Mr. Stiles, of Pennsylvania,
moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table, which was
lost,&mdash;Yeas 57, Nays 111. The previous question was then ordered.
On the motion to reconsider, the vote stood, Yeas 112, Nays 57, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>voting 13; but, a majority being sufficient for this purpose, the motion
to reconsider was agreed to. The question then recurred on the passage
of the joint resolution, when, on motion of Mr. Ashley, the previous
question was ordered. Before this was done, he stated that to
hasten a vote he had declined speaking. Mr. Brown, of Wisconsin,
asked him to yield, so that he might “offer a substitute for the joint
resolution.” Mr. Ashley could not yield; he had a substitute himself,
which he should much prefer to the original joint resolution, but he
did not offer it. On its final passage the vote stood, Yeas 119, Nays
56, not voting 8. So the two thirds required by the Constitution
having voted in its favor, the joint resolution was passed.</p>

<p>All possible preparation had been made for the vote, and the attendance
was unusually large, both of Representatives and spectators. The
people throughout the country awaited the result with profound interest.
The announcement by the Speaker was received with an outburst
of enthusiasm in the Chamber. The Republican Representatives sprang
to their feet and applauded with cheers and clapping of hands. The
spectators in the crowded galleries followed the example, and for several
minutes the Chamber was a scene of joy and congratulation. Mr.
Ingersoll, of Illinois, then said, “In honor of this immortal and sublime
event, I move that the House do now adjourn”; and the House adjourned.</p>

<p>The joint resolution submitting the Constitutional Amendment bears
date February 1, 1865. It now remained that the Amendment should be
ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, there
being at the time thirty-six. A certificate, announcing that this had
been done, was issued by the Secretary of State, December 18, 1865,
and from this date the Amendment became part of the Constitution.
President Lincoln, who had watched this event with absorbing interest,
did not live to witness the final result.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sumner saw so clearly the delay incident to a Constitutional
Amendment, and even the uncertainty with regard to its passage by
Congress and adoption by the States, that, while supporting it cordially,
he did not relax meanwhile his efforts for Congressional legislation
against Slavery. Even if Congress could not be induced, in the exercise
of its powers, to decree the death of the public enemy, he hoped
that at least it would not hesitate to use all other powers to limit and
weaken it, so that, should the Constitutional Amendment fail, or be
postponed, Slavery would be in a condition from which it could not
recover. His main postulate, that Slavery was contrary to Nature,
and an outlaw, was important in sustaining action against it, whether
by Constitutional Amendment or Congressional legislation. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
course of debate on another question, Mr. Sherman spoke incidentally
of the Constitutional Amendment as “the main proposition,” when
Mr. Sumner at once remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The main proposition, Sir, is to strike Slavery wherever you can hit it;
and I tell the Senator he will not accomplish his purpose, if he contents himself
merely with a Constitutional Amendment. I am for a Constitutional
Amendment; I have made the proposition in several forms: but how long
will it take to carry that Amendment through both Houses of Congress, and
then carry it to its final consummation in the votes of the Legislatures of
three fourths of the several States, according to the requirements of the Constitution?
Are we to postpone action on all these questions until that possibly
distant day? No, Sir!”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The speech which follows was published originally under the title,
“Universal Emancipation without Compensation.” In the edition of
the Loyal Publication Society of New York the title was “No Property
in Man.” These two titles present fundamental principles of special
significance at that time. They were in the nature of answer to
the clamor for compensation.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If an angel from the skies or
a stranger from another planet were permitted
to visit this earth and to examine its surface, who can
doubt that his eyes would rest with astonishment upon
the outstretched extent and exhaustless resources of this
republic, young in years, but already rooted beyond any
dynasty in history? In proportion as he considered
and understood all that enters into and constitutes the
national life, his astonishment would increase, for he
would find a numerous people, powerful beyond precedent,
without king or noble, but with the schoolmaster
instead. And yet the astonishment he confessed, as
all these things unrolled before him, would swell into
marvel, as he learned that in this republic, arresting
his admiration, where is neither king nor noble, but
the schoolmaster instead, there are four million human
beings in abject bondage, degraded to be chattels,
under the pretence of property in man, driven by the
lash like beasts, despoiled of all rights, even the right
to knowledge and the sacred right of family, so that
the relation of husband and wife is impossible and no
parent can claim his own child, while all are condemned
to brutish ignorance. Startled by what he
beheld, the stranger would naturally inquire by what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
authority, under what sanction, and through what
terms of law or constitution, this fearful inconsistency,
so shocking to human nature itself, continues
to be upheld. His growing wonder would know no
bound, when he was pointed to the Constitution of the
United States, as final guardian and conservator of this
peculiar and many-headed wickedness.</p>

<p>“And is it true,” the stranger would exclaim, “that,
in laying the foundations of this republic dedicated to
human rights, all these wrongs were positively established?”
He would ask to see that Constitution, and
to know the fatal words by which the sacrifice was
commanded. The trembling with which he began its
perusal would be succeeded by joy as he finished; for
he would find nothing in that golden text, not a single
sentence, phrase, or word even, to serve as origin,
authority, or apology for the outrage. And then his
wonder, already knowing no bound, would break forth
anew, as he exclaimed, “Shameful and irrational as is
Slavery, it is not more shameful or irrational than the
unsupported interpretation which makes your Constitution
final guardian and conservator of this terrible
and unpardonable apostasy.”</p>

<p>Such a stranger, coming from afar, with eyes that no
local bias had distorted, and with understanding no local
custom had disturbed, would naturally see the Constitution
in its precise text, and would interpret it in
its true sense, without prepossession or prejudice. Of
course he would know, what all jurisprudence teaches
and all reason confirms, that human rights cannot be
taken away by any indirection, or by any vain imagining
of something intended, but not said, and, as a natural
consequence, that Slavery exists, if exist it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
at all, only by virtue of <em>positive text</em>, and that what is
true of Slavery is true also of all its incidents; and the
enlightened stranger would insist, that, in every interpretation
of the Constitution, that cardinal principle
must never for a moment be out of mind, but must be
kept ever forward as guide and master, that <em>Slavery
cannot stand on inference</em>, nor can any support of Slavery
stand on inference. Thus informed, and in the
light of pervasive principle,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“How far that little candle throws his beams!”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he would peruse the Constitution from beginning to
end, from its opening Preamble to its final Amendment,
and then the joyful opinion would be given.</p>

<p>There are three things he must observe: first and
foremost, that the dismal words “Slave” and “Slavery”
do not appear in the Constitution; so that, if the unnatural
pretension of property in man lurk anywhere
in that text, it is under a feigned name, or an <i>alias</i>,
which is cause of suspicion, while an imperative rule
renders its recognition impossible. Next, he would
consider the Preamble, which is the key to open the
whole succeeding instrument; but here no single word
is found which does not open the Constitution to Freedom
and close it to Slavery. The object of the Constitution
is announced to be “in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
provide for the common defence, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of <em>liberty</em> to ourselves
and our posterity”; all of which, in every particular,
is absolutely inconsistent with Slavery. And, thirdly,
he would observe those time-honored, most efficacious,
chain-breaking words in the Amendments:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> “<em>No person
shall be deprived of</em> life, <em>liberty</em>, or property, <em>without
due process of law</em>.” Scorning all false interpretations
and glosses fastened upon the Constitution in support
of Slavery, and with these three things before him, he
would naturally declare that there was nothing in the
original text on which this appalling wrong could be
founded anywhere within the sphere of its operation.
With wonder he would ask again by what strange delusion
or hallucination the reason had been so far overcome
as to recognize Slavery in the Constitution, when
plainly it is not there, and cannot be there. The answer
is humiliating, but easy.</p>

<p>People find in texts of Scripture the support of their
own religious opinions or prejudices; and, in the same
way, they find in texts of the Constitution the support
of their political opinions or prejudices. And this may
not be in either case because Scripture or Constitution,
when truly interpreted, supports such opinions or prejudices,
but because people are apt to find in texts
simply a reflection of themselves. Most clearly and
indubitably, whoever finds support of Slavery in the
National Constitution has first found such support in
himself: not that he will hesitate, perhaps, to condemn
Slavery in words of approved gentleness, but because,
from unhappy education, or more unhappy insensibility
to the wrong, he has already conceded to it a certain
traditional foothold of immunity, which he straightway
transfers from himself to the Constitution. In dealing
with this subject, it is not the Constitution, so much
as human nature itself, which is at fault. Let the people
change, and the Constitution will change also; for
the Constitution is but the shadow, while the people
are the substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank God, under influence of the struggle for national
life, and in obedience to its incessant exigencies,
the people have changed, and in nothing so much as on
Slavery. Old opinions and prejudices have dissolved,
and that traditional foothold Slavery once possessed is
gradually weakening, until now it scarcely exists. Naturally
this change must sooner or later show itself in
the interpretation of the Constitution. But it is already
visible even there, in the concession of powers over
Slavery formerly denied. The time, then, has come
when the Constitution, so long interpreted for Slavery,
may be interpreted for Freedom. This is one
stage of triumph. Universal emancipation, which is
at hand, can be won only by complete emancipation of
the Constitution itself, which has been so long degraded
to wear chains that its real character is scarcely
known.</p>

<p>Sometimes the concession is made on the ground of
<em>military necessity</em>. The capacious war powers of the
Constitution are invoked, and it is said that in their
legitimate exercise Slavery may be destroyed. There is
much in this concession,&mdash;more even than is imagined
by many from whom it proceeds. It is war, say they,
which puts these powers in motion; but they forget, that,
wherever Slavery exists, there is perpetual war,&mdash;that
Slavery itself is a <em>state of war</em> between two races, where
one is for the moment victor,&mdash;pictured accurately by
Jefferson as “permitting one half the citizens to trample
on the rights of the other, transforming those into
despots and these into enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Therefore, wherever
Slavery exists, even in seeming peace, the war powers
may be invoked to terminate a condition which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
internecine, and to overthrow pretensions hostile to every
attribute of the Almighty.</p>

<p>It is not on military necessity alone that the concession
is made. Many, as they read the Constitution now,
see its powers over Slavery more clearly than before.
The old superstition is abandoned; and they join with
Patrick Henry, when, in the Virginia Convention, he declared
the power of manumission accorded to Congress.
He did not hesitate to argue against the adoption of the
Constitution, because it accorded this power. And shall
we be less perspicacious for Freedom than this Virginia
statesman for Slavery? Discerning the power, he confessed
his dismay: let us confess our joy.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Slavery finds no support
in the Constitution. Glance now at positive provisions
by which it is brought completely under control of
Congress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. First among the powers of Congress, and associated
with the power to lay and collect taxes, is that to
“provide for the common defence and general welfare.”
It is questioned whether this is a substantive power, or
simply incident to that with which it is associated. But
it is difficult, if not absurd, to insist that Congress has
not this substantive power. Shall it not provide for the
common defence? Shall it not regard the general welfare?
If powerless to do these things in a great crisis,
it had better abdicate. In the Virginia Convention,
Mr. George Mason, a most decided opponent of the Constitution,
said: “That Congress should have power to
provide for the general welfare of the Union <em>I grant</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
The language of Patrick Henry, to which allusion has
just been made, was more explicit. He foresaw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
this power would be directed against Slavery, and did
not hesitate to declare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slavery is detested. We feel its fatal effects. We deplore
it with all the pity of humanity. Let all these considerations,
at some future period, press with full force on the
minds of Congress; let that urbanity which, I trust, will
distinguish America, and the necessity of national defence,&mdash;let
all these things operate on their minds; they will
search that paper [the Constitution] and see if they have
power of manumission. And have they not, Sir? Have
they not power <em>to provide for the general defence and welfare</em>?
May they not think that these call for the abolition
of slavery? May they not pronounce all slaves free? And
will they not be warranted by that power? This is no ambiguous
implication or logical deduction. <em>The paper speaks
to the point. They have the power in clear, unequivocal terms,
and will dearly and certainly exercise it.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Language could not be more positive. To all who
ask for the power of Congress over Slavery, here is a
sufficient answer; and remember that this is not my
speech, but the speech of Patrick Henry, who says that
the Constitution “speaks to the point.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. Next comes the fountain, “Congress shall have
power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to
provide and maintain a navy.” A power like this is
from its nature unlimited. In raising and supporting
an army, in providing and maintaining a navy, Congress
is not restricted to any particular class or color.
It may call upon all, and authorize that <em>contract</em> which
the Government makes with an enlisted soldier. But
such contract would be in itself an act of manumission;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
for a slave cannot make a contract. And if the contract
be followed by actual service, who can deny its
completest efficacy in enfranchising the soldier-slave
and his whole family? Shakespeare, immortal teacher,
gives expression to an instinctive sentiment, when he
makes Henry the Fifth, on the eve of the victory at
Agincourt, encourage his men by promising,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</div>
<div class="verse">Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,</div>
<div class="verse">This day shall gentle his condition.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. There is still another clause: “The United States
shall guaranty to every State in this Union <em>a republican
form of government</em>.” Here again is a plain duty. But
the question recurs, What is a republican form of government?
John Adams, in the correspondence of his
old age, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The customary meanings of the words <em>republic</em> and <em>commonwealth</em>
have been infinite. They have been applied to
every government under heaven,&mdash;that of Turkey and that
of Spain, as well as that of Athens and of Rome, of Geneva
and San Marino.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But the guaranty of a republican form of government
must have a meaning congenial with the purposes of
the Constitution. If a government like that of Turkey,
or even that of Venice, could come within the scope of
this guaranty, it would be of little value; it would be
words, and nothing more. Evidently, it must be construed
so as to uphold the Constitution, according to
all the promises of its Preamble; and Mr. Madison
has left a record, first published to the Senate by the
distinguished Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of the Committee on the Library, showing that it was
originally suggested in part by the fear of Slavery,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> so
that in construing it we must not forget the disturbing
influence. The Preamble and the record are important,
disclosing the real intention. But no American need be
at loss to designate some of the distinctive elements of
a republic, according to the idea of American institutions.
These are found, first, in the Declaration of Independence,
by which it is solemnly announced “that
all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.” And they are found, secondly,
in that other guaranty and prohibition of the Constitution,
in harmony with the Declaration: “<em>No person</em>
shall be deprived of life, <em>liberty</em>, or property, <em>without
due process of law</em>.” Such are essential elements of “a
republican form of government,” which cannot be disowned
without disowning the very muniments of our
liberties; and these the United States are bound to
guaranty. But all these, when set in motion, make Slavery
impossible. It is idle to say that this result was
not anticipated. It would be, then, only another illustration
that our fathers “builded better than they
knew.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. Independent of the guaranty, there is the other
clause just quoted, in itself a source of power: “<em>No person</em>
shall be deprived of life, <em>liberty</em>, or property, <em>without
due process of law</em>.” This was part of the Constitutional
Amendments proposed by the First Congress, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the popular demand for a Bill of Rights. Though
brief, it is a whole Bill of Rights. Liberty can be lost
only by “due process of law,”&mdash;words borrowed from
the ancient liberty-loving Common Law, illustrated by
our master in law, Lord Coke, but best explained by
the late Mr. Justice Bronson, of New York, in a judicial
opinion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The meaning of the section, then, seems to be, that <em>no
member of the State shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any
of his rights or privileges</em>, unless the matter shall be adjudged
against him upon trial had according to the course of
the Common Law.… The words ‘due process of law,’
in this place, cannot mean less than a prosecution or suit
instituted and conducted according to the prescribed forms
and solemnities for ascertaining guilt or determining the
title to property.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the protection thrown by the Constitution
over every “person,” without distinction of race or color,
class or condition. There can be no doubt about the
universality of the protection. All, without exception,
come within its scope. The natural meaning is plain;
but there is an incident of history which makes it
plainer still, excluding all possibility of misconception.
A clause of this character was originally recommended
as an Amendment by two Slave States, Virginia and
North Carolina, and by a slave-trading State, Rhode
Island; but it was restricted by them to <em>freemen</em>, thus:
“No <em>freeman</em> ought to be deprived of his life, <em>liberty</em>, or
property, but by <em>the law of the land</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> When the recommendation
came before Congress, the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> “person”
was substituted for “freeman,” and the more searching
phrase “due process of law” was substituted for
“the law of the land.” In making this change, rejecting
the recommendation of slave-owning and slave-trading
States, the authors of this Amendment revealed their
purpose, that <em>no person</em> wearing the human form should
be deprived of <em>liberty</em> without due process of law; and
the proposition was adopted by the votes of Congress,
and then of the States, as part of the Constitution.
Clearly, on its face, it is an express guaranty of personal
liberty, and an express prohibition of its invasion anywhere.</p>

<p>In the face of this guaranty and prohibition,&mdash;for it
is both,&mdash;how can any “person” be held as slave?
Sometimes it is argued that this provision must be restricted
to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the National Government. Such formerly was my own
impression, often avowed in this Chamber; but I never
doubted its complete efficacy to render Slavery unconstitutional
in all such places, so that “no person” could
be held as a slave at the national capital or in any national
territory. Constitutionally, Slavery has always
been an outlaw, wherever that provision of the Constitution
was applicable. Nobody doubted that it was
binding on the national courts; and yet it was left
unexecuted, a dead letter, killed by the predominant
influence of Slavery, until at last Congress was obliged
by legislative act to do what the courts failed to do,
and to terminate Slavery in the national capital and
national territories.</p>

<p>In this transcendent guaranty and prohibition there
are no words of exclusive jurisdiction. All is broad
and general as the Constitution itself; and since this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
provision is in support of human rights, it cannot be
restricted by any interpretation. There is no limitation
in it, and nobody can supply any such limitation, without
encountering the venerable maxim of law, <i>Impius et
crudelis qui Libertati non favet</i>,&mdash;“Impious and cruel
is he who does not favor Liberty.” Long enough have
courts and Congress merited this condemnation. The
time has come when they should merit it no longer.
The Constitution should become a living letter under
the predominant influence of Freedom. This conviction
has brought petitioners to Congress, during the
present session, asking that the Constitution shall be
simply executed against Slavery, and not altered. Ah,
Sir, it would be a glad sight to see that Constitution,
which we have all sworn to support, interpreted generously,
nobly, gloriously for Freedom, so that everywhere
within its influence the chains should drop from the
slave! If it be said that this was not anticipated at
its adoption, I remind you of Patrick Henry, when, at
the time, he said, “The paper speaks to the point.” No
doubt, it does speak to the point, especially with the
Amendments immediately thereafter adopted. Cicero
preferred to err with Plato rather than to think right
with other men. And pardon me, if, when my country
is in peril from Slavery, and human rights are to be
rescued, I prefer to err with Patrick Henry, in assuming
power for Freedom, rather than to think right with
Senators who hesitate in such a cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, thus stands the case. There is nothing
in the Constitution on which Slavery can rest, or
find any the least support. Even on the face of that
instrument it is an <em>outlaw</em>; but if we look further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
into its provisions, we find at least four distinct sources
of power, which, if executed, must render Slavery impossible,
while the Preamble makes them all vital for
Freedom: first, the power to provide for the common
defence and general welfare; secondly, the power to
raise armies and maintain navies; thirdly, the power to
guaranty a republican form of government; and, fourthly,
the power to secure <em>Liberty</em> against all restraint without
due process of law. But all these provisions are
something more than powers; <em>they are duties also</em>. And
yet we are constantly and painfully reminded that pending
measures against Slavery are unconstitutional. Sir,
this is an immense mistake. <em>Nothing against Slavery
can be unconstitutional.</em> It is hesitation that is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>And yet Slavery still exists, in defiance of all these
requirements; nay, more, in defiance of reason and justice,
which can never be disobeyed with impunity, it
exists, the perpetual spoiler of human rights and disturber
of the public peace, degrading master as well as
slave, corrupting society, weakening government, impoverishing
the very soil itself, and impairing the natural
resources of the country. Such an outrage, so offensive
in every respect, not only to the Constitution, but
also to the whole system of order by which the universe
is governed, can be nothing but <em>a national nuisance</em>,
which, for the general welfare, and in the name of justice,
ought to be abated. But at this moment, when
it menaces the national life, it is not enough to treat
Slavery merely as a nuisance, for it is much more. It
is a public enemy and traitor, wherever it shows itself,
to be subdued, in the discharge of solemn guaranties of
Government, and in the exercise of unquestionable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
indefeasible rights of self-defence. All now admit that
in the Rebel States it is <em>a public enemy and traitor</em>, so
that the Rebellion is seen in Slavery, and Slavery is seen
in the Rebellion. But Slavery throughout the country,
everywhere within the national limits, is a living Unit,
one and indivisible,&mdash;and thus even outside the Rebel
States it is the same public enemy and traitor, lending
succor to the Rebellion, and holding out “blue lights”
to encourage and direct its operations. But whether
national nuisance or public enemy and traitor, it is obnoxious
to the same judgment, and must be abolished.</p>

<p>If, in abolishing Slavery, injury were done to the just
interests of any human being, or to rights of any kind,
there might be something to “give us pause,” even against
these irresistible requirements. But nothing of the kind
can ensue. No just interests and no rights can suffer.
It is the rare felicity of such an act, as well outside as
inside the Rebel States, that, while striking a blow at
the Rebellion, and assuring future tranquillity, so that
the Republic shall be no longer a house divided against
itself, it will add at once to the value of the whole fee
simple wherever Slavery exists, will secure individual
rights, and will advance civilization itself.</p>

<p>There is another motive at this time. Embattled
armies stand face to face, one side fighting for Slavery.
The gauntlet that has been flung down we have taken
up in part only. Abolishing Slavery entirely, we take
up the gauntlet entirely. Then can we look with confidence
to Almighty God for His blessing upon our arms.
“Till America comes into this measure,” said John Jay
during the Revolution, “her prayers to Heaven for Liberty
will be impious.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> So long as we sustain Slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
so long as we hesitate to strike at Slavery, the heavy
battalions of our armies will fail. Sir Giles Overreach,
attempting to draw his sword, found it “glued to the
scabbard with wronged orphans’ tears.” God forbid that
our soldiers shall find their swords “glued” with the
tears of the slave!</p>

<p>One question, and only one, rises in our path,&mdash;and
this simply because the national representatives have
been so long drugged and drenched with Slavery, which
they have taken in all forms, whether of dose or douche,
that, like a long-suffering patient, they are still sunk under
its influence. I refer, of course, to the talk of compensation,
under the shameful assumption that there
can be property in man. Sir, there was a moment
when I was willing to pay for Emancipation largely, or
at least to any reasonable amount; but it was <em>as ransom</em>,
and never as compensation. Thank God, that time has
passed, never to return,&mdash;and simply because money is
no longer needed for the purpose. Our fathers, under
Washington, never paid the Algerines for our enslaved
fellow-citizens, except as ransom; and they ceased all
such tribute, when emancipation could be had without
it. Such must be our rule. Any other would impoverish
the Treasury for nothing. The time has come for
the old tocsin to sound, “Millions for defence, not a cent
for tribute!” Ay, Sir; millions of dollars&mdash;with millions
of strong arms also&mdash;for defence against Slave-Masters;
but not a cent for tribute to Slave-Masters.</p>

<p>If money is paid as compensation, clearly it cannot be
awarded to the master, who for generations robbed the
slave of his toil and all its fruits, so that, in justice, he
may be treated as trustee of accumulated earnings with
interest never paid over. Any money as compensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
must belong, every dollar, to the slave. If the case were
audited in Heaven’s chancery, there must be another allowance
for prolonged denial of inestimable rights. Loss
of wages may be estimated; but where is the tariff or
price-current by which to determine those greater losses
which have been the lot of every slave? Mortal arithmetic
is impotent to assess the fearful sum-total. In
presence of this infinite responsibility, the whole question
must be referred to that other tribunal where master
and slave are equal, while Infinite Wisdom tempers
justice with mercy. There is a Persian tradition of
Mahomet once saying that the greatest mortification at
the Day of Judgment will be when the pious slave is
carried to Paradise and the wicked master condemned
to Hell.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> It is only with finite powers that we on
earth can imitate Divine Justice.</p>

<p>The theory of compensation is founded on the intolerable
assumption of property in man, an idea which
often intrudes into these debates, sometimes from open
vindicators, and sometimes from others, who, while yielding,
yet reluctantly yield, and thus their conduct is
“sicklied o’er” with Slavery. Sir, parliamentary law
must be observed; but, if in a parliamentary assembly
indignant hisses are ever justifiable, they ought to break
forth at every mention of this thing, whatever form it
takes,&mdash;whether of arrogant claim, or mildest suggestion,
or equivocal hint. Impious toward God, and infidel
toward man, it is disowned by conscience and
reason alike; nor is there any softness of argument or
of phrase by which its essential wickedness can be
disguised. “The fool hath said in his heart there is no
God”; but it is kindred folly to say there is no Man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
The first is Atheism, and the second is like unto the
first. If in this world a man owns anything, it is himself.
This is his great patrimony, alike from his earthly
father and his Father in Heaven. It is indefeasible and
perpetual,&mdash;not to be sold, not to be bought. Always
owning himself, he cannot be owned by another.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>No man can make black white or wrong right; nor
can any Congress or any multitude overcome the everlasting
law of justice.</p>

<p>According to a well-known and capital principle of
jurisprudence, stolen property cannot be sold, and the
attempt to sell it, knowing the primary abstraction, is a
crime. The form of sale is impotent, and the title does
not pass. Wherever he finds his property, the original
owner may resume it as his own. The pawnbroker
who has received it in pledge must release his hold;
the purchaser who has paid the price must give it up.
But can a stolen man be sold? Is there any form of
sale which is not impotent to complete this great transfer,
so as to give it the semblance of validity against
the original owner? Can the title pass? Infinitely
absurd and unnatural is the pretext that a man may
reclaim his stolen coat wherever he finds it, but cannot
reclaim himself! Is the coat more than the man?
Slavery asserts that it is; and the whole country says
the same, when it sanctions the return of a fugitive
slave. But this pretension is only a further outgrowth
of that appalling tyranny which begins by denying the
right of a man to himself.</p>

<p>The Christian Church, by beautiful, glorious example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
testifies from earliest days against this pretension.
Hermes, Prefect of Rome, converted to Christ, comes to
church on Easter with twelve hundred and fifty slaves,
whom after baptism he sets free. Chromatius, another
Prefect of Rome, under Diocletian, also a convert, gives
liberty after baptism to fourteen hundred, while he proclaims,
“They who begin to be children of God must not
be slaves of men.” St. Germain, the admirable Bishop
of Paris, on receiving alms, cries out, “Thanks be to
God, we can now ransom a slave!” This list might
be extended. Better even than such personal testimony
is the same sentiment manifest in social institutions.
St. Theodore, illustrious in the Eastern Church, imposed
this rule upon its monasteries: “You must never
employ slaves, neither in personal service, nor in affairs
of the convent, nor in culture of the earth; <em>the slave
is a man created in the image of God</em>.” The Church of
the West was not less earnest. St. Benedict of Aniane,
the second of the name in canonization, would not
allow convents to be served by a slave. In the bosom
of these retreats, as also in the priesthood, the former
slave mingled with the former lord, nor was there any
obstacle between him and the bishop’s crosier. Onesimus,
once the slave of Philemon, and hailed as brother
beloved by Paul, is said to have become bishop of
Ephesus.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>In the testimony of the Christian Church there is one
character of precious example: I refer to Pope Gregory,
justly meriting by his life the title of Great, which
has been preserved by history. Through him England
first tasted the blessings of Christianity. Fair-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Saxons from the distant island, standing for sale in the
market of Rome, enlisted his sympathy. When told
that they were Angles, he exclaimed, “Not Angles, but
Angels,”&mdash;“<i>Non Angli, sed Angeli</i>”&mdash;and he insisted
on their ransom and instruction to become the apostles
of their countrymen. Under his auspices St. Augustin
commenced the work, so that the conversion of England
may be traced to the sympathies aroused by English
slaves on the banks of the Tiber. A letter from St.
Gregory shows the spirit in which he acted. Giving
freedom to two bondmen, he wrote these commanding
words: “Since our Redeemer, Maker of the whole creation,
being hereto propitiated, has been pleased to assume
human flesh, that, by the grace of his divinity, the
chain of slavery wherewith we were held captive being
broken, he might restore us to pristine liberty, it is well
that men whom Nature from the beginning has brought
forth free and the law of nations has subjected to the
yoke of servitude, should by benefit of manumission be
restored to the liberty wherein they were born.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> And
do not these words speak to us now?</p>

<p>Foremost of all in history who have vindicated human
liberty, and associated their names with it forevermore,
stands John Milton, Secretary of Oliver Cromwell, and
author of “Paradise Lost.” Cradled under a lawless
royalty, he helped to found and support the English
Commonwealth, while in all that he wrote he pleaded
for human rights,&mdash;now in defence of the English people,
who had beheaded their king, and now in immortal
poems which show how wisely and well he loved the
cause he had made his own. Nowhere has the assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of property in man been encountered more completely
than in the conversation between the Archangel
and Adam, after the former had pictured a hunter
whose game was “men, not beasts”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O execrable son, so to aspire</div>
<div class="verse">Above his brethren, to himself assuming</div>
<div class="verse">Authority usurped, from God not given!</div>
<div class="verse">He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl</div>
<div class="verse">Dominion absolute; that right we hold</div>
<div class="verse">By His donation; but man over men</div>
<div class="verse">He made not lord, such title to Himself</div>
<div class="verse">Reserving, human left from human free.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every assertor of this property puts himself in the
very place of the hunter of “men, not beasts,” described
as “execrable son, so to aspire.” The language is not
too strong. “Execrable” is the assumption,&mdash;“execrable”
wherever made: “execrable” on the plantation,
“execrable” in this Chamber, “execrable” in every
form it takes, “execrable” in all its consequences, especially
“execrable” as an apology for hesitation against
Slavery. The assumption, wherever it shows itself,
must be beaten down under our feet, like Satan himself,
in whom it has its origin.</p>

<p>Again, we are brought by learned Senators to the
Constitution, which requires that there shall be “just
compensation,” where “private property” is taken for
public use. But, plainly, here the requirement is absolutely
inapplicable, for there is no “private property” to
take. Slavery is but a bundle of barbarous pretensions,
from which certain persons are to be released. At what
price shall the bundle be estimated? How much shall
be paid for the controlling pretension of property in
man? How much allowed for that other pretension to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
shut the gates of knowledge, and keep the victim from
the Book of Life? How much given for ransom from
the pretension to rob a human being of his toil and
all its fruits? And, Sir, what “just compensation”
shall be voted for renouncing that Heaven-defying
pretension, too disgusting to picture, which, trampling
on the most sacred relations, makes wife and child the
wretched prey of lust and avarice? Let these pretensions
be renounced, and Slavery ceases to exist; but
there can be no “just compensation” for any such renunciation.
Heart, reason, religion, the Constitution
itself, rise in judgment against it. As well vote “just
compensation” to the hardened offender who renounces
disobedience to the Ten Commandments, and promises
that he will cease to steal, cease to commit adultery,
and cease to covet his neighbor’s wife! Ay, Sir,
there is nothing in the Constitution to sanction any
such outrage. Such an appropriation would be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Mr. Madison said in the Convention that it was
“wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there
could be property in men.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Of course it was wrong.
It was criminal and unpardonable. Thank God, it
was not done. But Senators admit this “idea” daily.
They take it from themselves, and then introduce it
where Mr. Madison said it was “wrong.” But if
“wrong” at the adoption of the Constitution, how much
worse now! There is no instinct of patriotism, as there
is no conclusion of reason, which must not be against
the abomination; and yet, Sir, it is allowed to enter
into these debates. Sometimes it stalks, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
it skulks; but whether stalking or skulking, it must be
encountered with the same indignant rebuke, until it
ventures no longer to show its head.</p>

<p>Putting aside, then, all objection, whether from open
opposition or lukewarm support, the great question recurs,
that question which dominates this debate, How
shall Slavery be overthrown? The answer is threefold:
first, by the courts, declaring and applying the true
principles of the Constitution; secondly, by Congress,
in the exercise of the powers belonging to it; and,
thirdly, by the people, through an Amendment of the
Constitution. Court, Congress, people, all may be invoked;
and the occasion justifies the appeal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. Let the appeal be made to the courts. But, alas!
one of the saddest chapters in our history is the conduct
of judges, lending themselves to the support of Slavery.
Injunctions of the Constitution, guaranties of personal
liberty, and prohibitions against its invasion have all
been forgotten. Courts, which should be asylums of
Liberty, have been changed into strongholds of Slavery;
and the Supreme Court of the United States, by final
decision as shocking to the Constitution as to the public
conscience, proclaimed itself tutelary stronghold of
all. It was part of the national calamity, that, under
the influence of Slavery, Justice, like Astræa of old, fled.
But now, at last, in a regenerated Republic, with Slavery
waning, and the people rising in judgment against it, let
us hope that the judgments of courts may be reconsidered,
and the powers of the Constitution in behalf of
Liberty fully exercised, so that human bondage shall
no longer find an unnatural support from the lips of
judges,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">“and ancient fraud shall fail,</div>
<div class="verse">Returning Justice lift aloft her scale.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir, no court can afford to do an act of wrong. Its
business is justice; and when, under any apology, it
ceases to do justice, it loses those titles to reverence
otherwise so willingly bestowed. There are instances
of great magistrates openly declaring disobedience to
laws “against common right and reason,” and their
names are mentioned with gratitude in the history
of jurisprudence. There are other instances of men
holding the balance and the sword, whose names are
gathered into a volume as “atrocious judges.” If our
judges, cruelly interpreting the Constitution in favor
of Slavery, do not come into the latter class, they can
claim no place among those others who have stood
for justice, like the rock on which the sea breaks
in idle spray. Vainly do you attempt to frame injustice
into a law, or to sanctify it by any judgment
of court. From Cicero we learn, that, “if commands
of the people, if decrees of princes, if <em>opinions of
judges</em> were sufficient to constitute right, then were
it right to commit highway robbery, right to commit
adultery, right to set up forged wills.”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> And Augustine
tells us, with saintly authority, that what is unjust
cannot be law.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Every law and every judgment of
court, to be binding, must have at its back the everlasting,
irrepealable law of God. Doubtless the model
decision of the American bench, destined to be quoted
hereafter with most honor, because the boldest in its
conformity with great principles of humanity and
social order, was that of the Vermont judge who refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to surrender a fugitive slave <em>until his pretended
master could show a title-deed from the Almighty</em>.</p>

<p>But courts have no longer occasion for such boldness.
They need not step outside the Constitution. It is only
needed that they should follow just principles in its
interpretation. Let them be guided by a teacher like
Edmund Burke, who spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>Men cannot covenant themselves out of their rights and their
duties</em>; nor by any other means can arbitrary power be conveyed
to any man. <em>Those who give to others such rights perform
acts that are void as they are given.…</em> Those who
give and those who receive arbitrary power are alike criminal,
and there is no man but is bound to resist it to the best
of his power, wherever it shall show its face to the world. It
is a crime to bear it, when it can be rationally shaken off.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Or let them be guided by that other teacher, Lord
Chatham, when he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With respect to the decisions of courts of justice, I am
far from denying them their due weight and authority;
yet, placing them in the most respectable view, I still consider
them, not as law, but as an evidence of the law; and
before they can arrive even at that degree of authority, it
must appear that they are founded in and confirmed by
reason,&mdash;that they are supported by precedents taken from
good and moderate times,&mdash;that they do not contradict
any positive law,&mdash;that they are submitted to without
reluctance by the people,&mdash;that they are unquestioned by
the legislature (which is equivalent to a tacit confirmation),&mdash;<em>and,
what in my judgment is by far the most important,
that they do not violate the spirit of the Constitution</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Or let them go back to that early Spanish testimony
against the Slave-Trade and Slavery, when De Soto, in
lectures at Salamanca, thus spoke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is affirmed that the unhappy Ethiopians are by fraud
or force carried away and sold as slaves. If this is true,
neither those who have taken them, nor those who purchased
them, nor those who hold them in bondage can
ever have a quiet conscience till they emancipate them,
<em>even if no compensation should be obtained</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Or, let them accept the unanswerable judgment of
that acute moralist, the late Archbishop Whately,
who in simple words shows the superior title of the
slave:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A slave cannot fairly be called a thief for taking anything
from his master, or for stealing his own liberty. He
may be considered as in an enemy’s country, in the midst
of those who recognize no rights of his as against them, and
who therefore have no rights as against him.”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If courts were thus inspired, it is easy to see that
Slavery would disappear under righteous judgment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. Unhappily, courts will not perform the duty of
the hour, and we turn elsewhere. Appeal must be
made to Congress; and here, as has been fully developed,
the powers are ample, unless in their interpretation
you surrender in advance to Slavery. By a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
brief statute, Congress may sweep Slavery out of
existence. Patrick Henry saw and declared, that, under
the influence of a growing detestation of Slavery
and the increasing “urbanity” of the people, this must
be expected, while all the capacious war powers proclaim
trumpet-tongued that it can be done constitutionally,
and the peace powers echo back the war
powers.</p>

<p>Here we encounter again the “execrable” pretension
of property in man, with the attendant claim of “just
compensation” for the renunciation of Heaven-defying
wrongs. But this is no more incident to abolition by
Act of Congress than by Amendment of the Constitution;
so that, “if just compensation” can be discarded
in one case, it can be in the other. But the votes
on the latter proposition already taken in the Senate
testify that it is discarded. Sir, let the “execrable”
pretension never again be named, except for condemnation,
no matter how or when it appears, or what
form it takes. Let the “idea,” originally branded as
so “wrong” that it could not find place in the Constitution,
never find place in our debates.</p>

<p>Even if Congress be not prepared for that single decisive
measure promptly ending this whole question and
striking Slavery to death, there are other measures by
which the end may be hastened. The towering Upas
may be girdled, even if not felled at once to earth.
Already, by Acts of Congress, Slavery is abolished in
the national capital and in the national territories. This
is not enough.</p>

<p>The Fugitive Slave Bill, conceived in iniquity, and
imposed upon the North as a badge of subjugation, may
be repealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The coastwise Slave-Trade may be deprived of all support
in the statute-book.</p>

<p>The traffic in human beings, as an article of “commerce
among the States,” may be extirpated.</p>

<p>And, above all, that odious rule of evidence, so injurious
to justice and discreditable to the country, excluding
the testimony of colored persons, may be abolished,
at least in national courts.</p>

<p>And there is one other thing to be done. The enlistment
of colored persons must be encouraged by legislation
in every possible form; for enlistment is emancipation.
That contract whereby the soldier-slave promises
service at hazard of life, like the contract of marriage,
fixes the equality of the parties, which Congress, for the
national defence, and the national character also, will
sacredly maintain.</p>

<p>All these things at least may be done, and, when they
are done, Heaven and Earth will be glad, for they will
have assurance that all will be done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. Nor will even these suffice. The people must
be summoned to confirm the whole work. It is for
them to put the capstone upon the sublime structure.
An Amendment of the Constitution may do what courts
and Congress decline to do, or, even should they act,
it may cover their action with its panoply. Such
an Amendment will give completeness and permanence
to Emancipation, while bringing the Constitution into
avowed harmony with the Declaration of Independence.
Happy day, long wished for, destined to gladden
those beatified spirits who have labored on earth to this
end, but died without the sight!</p>

<p>And yet I would not indiscreetly take counsel of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
hopes. From the nature of the case, such an Amendment
cannot be consummated at once. Time must intervene,
with opportunities of opposition. It can pass
Congress only by a vote of two thirds in both branches;
and then it must be adopted by the Legislatures of
three fourths of the States. Even under most favorable
circumstances, it is impossible to say when it can become
part of the Constitution. Too tardily, I fear, for
all the good that is sought. Therefore I am not content
with this measure alone. It postpones till to-morrow
what ought to be done to-day; and I much fear that it
will be made the apology for indifference to other efforts
of direct practical value,&mdash;as if it were pardonable to
neglect for a day the duties we owe to Human Rights.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">When will rise that to-morrow’s sun, to witness that

<p>For myself, let me confess, that, in presence of the
mighty events now thronging, I feel how insignificant
is any individual, whether citizen or Senator; and yet,
humbly longing to do my part, I would not put off till
to-morrow what ought to be done to-day,&mdash;especially
can I not consent to this great postponement. Our fellow-men
are in bonds: they must be relieved. Most
beautiful that ancient story, where the philosopher,
while on a mission to a great king for the release of
captives, being invited to sup, replied in the famous
words of Ulysses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> “O Circe! what man of a right mind
could let himself touch meat or drink before he had

captives were set free at once.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Beyond my general desire to see an act of universal
emancipation, at once and forever settling this great
question, so that it may no longer be the occasion of
strife between us, there are two other objects ever present
to my mind as a practical legislator: first, to strike
at Slavery wherever I can hit it; and, secondly, to
clear the statute-book of all existing supports of Slavery,
so that this great wrong may find nothing there to
which it can cling for life. Less than this, at the present
moment, when Slavery is still menacing, would be
abandonment of duty.</p>

<p>So long as a single slave continues anywhere beneath
the flag of the Republic, I am unwilling to rest. Too
well I know the vitality of Slavery with its infinite
capacity of propagation, and how little Slavery it takes
to make a Slave State with all the cruel pretensions
of Slavery. The down of a single thistle is full of all
possible thistles, and a single fish is said to contain
many millions of eggs, so that the whole sea may be
stocked from its womb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The modern founder of political science, Machiavelli,
writer as well as statesman, in his most instructive work,
the Discourses on Livy, has a chapter entitled, “For a
Republic to have long life, it is necessary to bring it
back often to its origin”:<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> where he shows how the
native virtue in which a Republic was founded becomes
so far corrupted that in process of time the body-politic
is destroyed,&mdash;as in the case of the natural body, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
according to the doctors of medicine, something is daily
added, from time to time requiring cure. The remarkable
publicist teaches under this head that Republics
are brought back to their origin, and to the principles
in which they were founded, by pressure from without,
where prudence fails within; and he affirms that the destruction
of Rome by the Gauls was necessary, in order
that the Republic might have a new birth, with new life
and new virtue,&mdash;all of which ensued, when the barbarians
were driven back. If the illustration is fanciful,
there is wisdom in the counsel; and now the time has
come for its application. The Gauls are upon us, not
from a distance, but domestic Gauls, flinging their swords,
like Brennus, into the scales; and we, too, may profit by
the occasion to secure for the Republic a new birth, with
new life and new virtue. Happily, the way is easy; for
there is no doubt of its baptismal vows, or the declared
sentiments of its origin. There is the Declaration of
Independence: let its solemn promises be redeemed.
There is the Constitution: let it speak according to
the promises of the Declaration. Let it speak, and the
last act of the great American tragedy will be ended,
while the stage is piled with corpses. From its early
beginning in the hold of the Dutch ship on its way to
Jamestown, as the Pilgrims in the Mayflower were on
their way to Plymouth, down to this bloody Rebellion,
Slavery has been a prolonged tragedy. History and Art
will hereafter portray the scenes. Nor can its death be
otherwise than an epoch, not only for our own country,
but for mankind. Slavery in its distant origin was the
substitute for death. The slave was allowed to live, but
without the rights of man. Instead of death in the
grave with its insensibility and decay, there was death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in life with constant degradation and suffering. Hence
in all ages the awakened sympathies of the good and
humane,&mdash;heard sometimes in sorrow for the unhappy
fate of an individual, and then in appeal for a race.</p>

<p>How truly affecting are the words of Homer, depicting
the wife of Hector toiling as bondwoman at the looms
of her Grecian master,&mdash;or those other undying words
which exhibit man in Slavery as shorn of half his
worth! The story of Joseph sold by his brothers has
been repeated in every form, touching innumerable
hearts. Borrowed from the Bible, it figured in the moralities
of the Middle Ages and in the later theatre of
France. How genius triumphed over Slavery is part of
this testimony. Æsop, the fabulist,&mdash;one of the world’s
greatest teachers, if not lawgivers,&mdash;was a slave; so
also was Phædrus, the Roman fabulist, whose lessons
are commended by purity and elegance; and so, too,
was Alcman, the lyric, who shed upon Sparta the grace
of poesy. To these add Epictetus, sublime in morals,&mdash;and
Terence, incomparable in comedy, who gave to
the world that immortal verse, which excited the applause
of the Roman theatre, “I am a man, and nothing
which concerns mankind is foreign to me.” Nor
should it be forgotten that the life of Plato was checkered
by Slavery.</p>

<p>In later days the sympathy is more for a race than
for individuals. Unhappily, the ban of color has become
a certificate of Slavery, and a large portion of
the human family, whose offence was a skin darkened
by the hand of God, has been degraded to the condition
of chattels. The sympathies once awakened
only for illustrious gifts are now bestowed upon suffering
humanity, marking an advance in civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
To be a man is a sufficient title-deed for the rights
of man, which we seek to establish. But their triumph
among us will be the certain herald of triumph
everywhere. In other places Slavery may linger
yet a little longer; but its death here will make
its continued existence impossible wherever civilization
prevails.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, the immediate question before us is
on the proposition to prohibit Slavery in our country
by Constitutional Amendment; and here I hope to be
indulged with regard to the form it should take. A
new text of the Constitution cannot be considered too
carefully even in this respect, especially when it is
nothing less than a new article of Freedom. For a
moment we are performing something of that duty
which belongs to the <i>conditores imperiorum</i>, placed
foremost by Lord Bacon in “the degrees of sovereign
honor,”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and “words” become “things.” From the
magnitude of the task we may naturally borrow circumspection,
and I approach this part of the question
with suggestion rather than argument.</p>

<p>Let me say frankly that I should prefer a form of
expression different from that having the favor of the
Committee. They have selected what was intended for
the old Jeffersonian Ordinance, sacred in our history,
although, let me add, they have not imitated it closely.
But I must be pardoned, if I venture to doubt the expediency
of perpetuating in the Constitution language
which, if it have any signification, seems to imply that
“Slavery or involuntary servitude” may be provided
for “the punishment of crime.” Instances anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
to the Constitution show the origin of this exception.
In the absence of penitentiaries, Slavery was a punishment
adjudged by courts. According to early Colonial
records in Massachusetts, one William Andrews “was
censured to be severely whipped and delivered up as a
slave to whom the Court shall appoint.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> But it cannot
be intended to sanction such judgment now. There
can be no reason why Slavery should not be forbidden
positively and without exception, especially as “imprisonment”
cannot be confounded with this “peculiar”
wrong. If my desires could prevail, I would put aside
the Ordinance, and find another form.</p>

<p>I know nothing better than this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All persons are equal before the law, so that no person
can hold another as a slave: and the Congress shall have
the power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry
this declaration into effect everywhere within the United
States and the jurisdiction thereof.”</p>

</div>

<p>By the latter clause the declaration is plainly applicable
to the States, while the earlier words assert the
equality of all persons before the law,&mdash;a fruitful principle,
assuring to all the same rights. <i>Inter pares non
est potestas</i>, “Among equals there is no superiority,”
is a received maxim of law, expressing a natural truth.
Therefore, where all are equal, there can be no Slavery;
so that, in declaring equality before the law, you
make Slavery, alike with superiority, impossible. This
language, though unknown to the Common Law and
new in our country, has a fixed place in modern constitutional
history. To understand how it has reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
its present authority we must repair for a moment to
France, so rich in experience and in genius.</p>

<p>Bills of Rights in England were moderate in terms,
compared with our Declaration of Independence, and
with the Declarations of Rights first announced by
France in the throes of terrible revolution, and since
recognized among the permanent triumphs of that prodigious
outbreak. Until this period there had been no
written Constitution in France, though since there have
been many in succession. The earliest, in September,
1791, was preceded by a Declaration of Rights, proposed
by Lafayette, which, after setting forth that “ignorance,
forgetfulness, or contempt of the rights of man
are the sole causes of public evils and of the corruption
of Governments,” undertakes to announce what it calls
“the natural rights of man, inalienable and sacred”;
and this is done&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the end that this Declaration, being constantly present
to all the members of the social body, may incessantly
recall to them their rights and their duties; to the end that
the acts of the legislative power, and those of the executive
power, being every moment capable of comparison with
the object of every political institution, may be more respected
by them; to the end that the claims of the citizens,
being henceforth founded on simple and incontestable
principles, may always turn to the maintenance of the Constitution
and to the happiness of all.”</p>

</div>

<p>This too elaborate, but instructive preamble, is followed
by an article with a generality of expression not
unlike that of our own Declaration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article I.</span> Men are born and continue free and <em>equal in
rights</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>In the sixth article of the Declaration this is explained
by declaring that the law “ought to be the
same for all, whether it protect, whether it punish,”
and then it speaks of “all citizens being <em>equal in its
eyes</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>In June, 1793, another Constitution was adopted,
which, after a brief preamble, opens with these articles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article I.</span> The object of society is the common happiness.
Government is instituted to guaranty to man the enjoyment
of his natural and imprescriptible rights.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article II.</span> These rights are equality, liberty, security,
property.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article III.</span> <em>All men are equal</em> by nature and <em>before the
law</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the new statement begins to appear. Men are
equal by nature and before the law.</p>

<p>“Equal before the law.” This term, which, by its essential
accuracy and self-limitation, excludes all uncertainty,
exaggeration, or vagueness, was already known
in the literature of France. Voltaire, whose wonderful
genius was so peculiarly French, with that constant
clearness which is the boast of the French language, had
used it in one of his philosophical poems, where political
truth is commended in the manner of Pope. The
first of these was in 1734, on “Equality of Conditions,”
where he says, “Mortals are equal; their mask is different”;
and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> “To have the same rights to happiness,
this is for us the perfect and only equality”;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
thus, like our Declaration of Independence, placing “the
pursuit of happiness” among natural rights. This assertion
of equal rights was defined in the poem on
“The Law of Nature,” addressed to Frederick, King of
Prussia, and written in 1752, where he says, “<em>The law</em>
in every State ought to be universal; <em>mortals</em>, whoever
they may be, <em>are equal before it</em>.” But I cite the precise
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<em>La loi</em> dans tout État doit être universelle:</div>
<div class="verse">Les mortels, quels qu’ils soient, <em>sont égaux devant elle</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This happy statement naturally passed from the poem
to the Constitution.</p>

<p>It was much to declare equality; it was more still to
do it with accuracy of form defying assault. This conquest
of the Revolution assumed its most precise enunciation
on the restoration of the Bourbons, when it appeared
as the first article in the Constitutional Charter
of Louis the Eighteenth, promulgated in 1814.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Article I.</span> <em>Frenchmen are equal before the law</em>, whatever
may otherwise be their titles and their ranks.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And it was repeated by Napoleon, April 22, 1815, on his
return from Elba.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>At the installation of Louis Philippe as king, in
August, 1830, with Lafayette by his side, the same
declaration was placed at the head of the Constitutional
Charter.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile this expression passed from France into
the Constitutions of other countries: of Holland, in
1801, where the declaration was, “All members of society
are equal before the law, without distinction of rank
or birth”;<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, created by
Napoleon in 1807, where we meet these terms: “Slavery
is abolished; all citizens are equal before the law”;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
of the Canton of Zug, in Switzerland, in 1814, where,
among “General Principles,” is the article, “All the citizens
of the Canton are equal before the law, and there
are no subjects in the Canton of Zug”;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> of Bavaria, in
1818, where “equality of the rights of the citizens before
the law” is enumerated in the preamble among “the
principal features of the Constitution”;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> of Bolivia, in
South America, where in 1825 we meet the words, “All
citizens are equal before the law”;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> of Portugal, in
1826, where it is declared, “The law is equal for all,
whether it protects, whether it punishes”;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> of Brazil,
where in the same year was a similar declaration;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
and then of Greece, not only in the Provisional Constitution
of 1822, but in the permanent Constitution of
1827, when the Greek nation “proclaims before God
and before man its political existence and its independence,”
and then among its fundamental principles declares,
“All Greeks are equal before the law.”<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The French Revolution of 1830 quickened this statement
anew. Belgium adopted it in 1831,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and even
Austria in 1849; the latter power as follows: “All subjects
are equal before the law, and judged according to
the same fundamental rights”;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and Sardinia, in 1848,
as follows: “All natives of the kingdom, whatever their
titles or their rank, are equal before the law.”<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The
same words reappear in the Fundamental Statute of
Italy, in 1861, when that classical land became a nation.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless the extensive adoption of this formula testifies
to its value in expressing an important principle,
being nothing less than the primal truth declared by
our fathers. All will confess its comparative precision.
The sophistries of Calhoun, founded on the obvious inequalities
of body and mind, are all overthrown by this
simple statement, which, though borrowed latterly from
France, is older than French history. I have had occasion
before to remind the curious student that the
ancient Greek of Herodotus supplies a single word for
this phrase, when it is said that “the Government of
the many has the most beautiful name of ἰσονομία,”
or <em>equality before the law</em>.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The father of history was
right. The name is most beautiful. But he did not see
all its beauty; nor did the three Persian satraps, whose
dialogue he reports,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> know how great a truth was revealed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Not till after generations and ages had passed
was <em>equality before the law</em> authoritatively declared; and
now, while involving it as a rule, we repair to that
bountiful Greek tongue, which, at that early day, by a
single word, anticipated our modern exigency. Such
a word, originally adopted in our Declaration of Independence,
would have superseded criticism.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to explain the origin of a term
which has played an important part. Though traced to
distant antiquity, and now adopted in various countries,
it derives its modern authority from France, where it
is the “well-ripened fruit” of unprecedented experience
in the discussion of great problems in political science.
Naturally, it does not come from England; for the
idea finds little favor in that hierarchical kingdom. In
France Equality prevails more than Liberty: in England
Liberty more than Equality. Here among us both
should find a home; and such a declaration as I now
propose, embodying <em>Liberty and Equality</em>, will keep the
double idea perpetual in the public mind and conscience,
“to warn, to comfort, and command.” The denial of Liberty
in the Rebel States begins with the denial of Equality;
so that our work is not completely done without
the assertion of both principles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In making Equality the fundamental principle, underlying
Liberty itself, I follow reason and authority.
Clearly, where all are equal, there can be no Slavery.
Equality makes Slavery impossible, while it broadens
Liberty into that community of right which is the
essence of Republican Government. A remarkable
French writer, La Boëtie, whose short life was brightened
by the friendship of Montaigne, well exhibits the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
dependence of Liberty upon Equality. In his little
work, “Voluntary Servitude,” which inspires astonishment
in all who read it, while vindicating and exalting
Liberty as derived from Nature, and setting forth how
“this good mother” has given to us all the whole earth
for a home, has lodged us all in the same house, has
fashioned us all according to the same pattern, so that
each can see and recognize one in another, and then,
alluding to the gift of voice and speech for our better
mutual acquaintance and fraternity, also to the means
by which Nature ties and binds so strongly the knot
of our alliance and society, also to the manifestation
in all things that she did not wish so much to make
us all united as all one, the precocious philosopher declares:
“There can be no doubt that we are all naturally
free, <em>since we are all companions</em>, and it cannot fall into
any human head that Nature has put anybody in slavery,
<em>having put us all in company</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Here is exhibited
that controlling Equality which has prevailed in
France.</p>

<p>A recent English publicist and professor exhibits also
the predominance of this principle: I refer to Mr. Maine,
who, in his work on “Ancient Law,” after tracing it to
the jurisconsults of the Antonine era, and asserting that
it “is one of a large number of legal propositions which
in progress of time have become political,” attests the
influence of France, which, according to him, is seen in
our own Declaration of Independence, where what he
calls “the specially French assumption,” that all men
are born equal, is joined with what he calls “the assumption
more familiar to Englishmen,” that all men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
are born free; and he adds, that, “of all the ‘principles
of 1789,’ it is the one which has been least strenuously
assailed, which has most thoroughly leavened modern
opinion, and which promises to modify most deeply
the constitution of societies and the politics of states.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
And now I venture to suggest that this guiding principle
be recognized by us in words commended by
usage and intrinsic character.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Should the Senate not incline to this form, there is
still another I would suggest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slavery shall not exist anywhere within the United
States or the jurisdiction thereof; and the Congress shall
have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry
this prohibition into effect.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is simple, and avoids all language open to question.
The word “Slavery” is explicit, and describes
precisely what you propose to blast. There is no doubt
with regard to its signification. It cannot be confounded
with “the punishment of crime”; for imprisonment
is not Slavery; nor can any punishment take the form
of a wrong which stands by itself, peculiar, terrible, outrageous.
Therefore nothing about punishment should
find place in the rule we now ordain. Beyond this I
would avoid technicality, which is out of place in such
a text; and here I am encouraged by other examples.
An early Constitution of France prohibited Slavery in
every form, when it said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> “Every man can engage his
time and his services, but he cannot sell himself, nor
be sold; his person is not alienable property.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> That
of the Greek nation was equally thorough: “It is not
permitted in Greece to sell or to buy men; every slave,
whatever may be his nation or religion, is free from the
time he puts foot on Greek territory.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Nothing can
be simpler than this prohibition in the Bavarian Constitution:
“Servitude is everywhere suppressed”;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> or
than this in the Constitution of Wurtemberg: “Serfdom
is forever abolished”;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> or than this in the Constitution
of the French Republic in November, 1848:
“Slavery cannot exist upon any French soil.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Nor
can anything be more simple and thorough than these
words from Hayti: “Slaves cannot exist on the territory
of the Republic. Slavery there is forever abolished.”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
Naturally a Republic of enfranchised slaves
made this the first article of its Constitution, while
sense as well as instinct supplied the form. And, Sir,
in all these historic instances you will remark that
there is nothing technical.</p>

<p>If the Senate is determined to follow the Jeffersonian
Ordinance, then I prefer that it should be the Ordinance
actually, and not as reported by the Committee. And I
would complete the work by expelling from the Constitution
all those words so often misconstrued, perverted,
and tortured to a false support of Slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>But while desirous of seeing the great rule of Freedom
we are about to ordain embodied in a text which
shall be like the precious casket to the more precious
treasure, yet I confess that I feel humbled by my
own endeavors. And whatever the judgment of the
Senate, I am consoled by the thought that the most
homely text containing such a rule will be more beautiful
far than any word of poet or orator, and will endure
to be read with gratitude, when the lofty dome of this
Capitol, with the statue of liberty which crowns it, has
crumbled to earth.</p>

<p>December 10, 1863, Mr. Sumner gave notice of his intention to introduce
a bill to repeal all acts for the rendition of fugitive slaves.</p>

<p>February 8, 1864, in pursuance of previous notice, Mr. Sumner
asked and obtained leave to introduce the bill above mentioned, which
was read twice by its title, and referred to the Select Committee on
Slavery and Freedmen.</p>

<p>February 29th, Mr. Sumner reported from the Committee a bill with
an accompanying report, of which ten thousand extra copies were ordered
to be printed.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> There was a minority report by Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania,
which was also printed in equal number.</p>

<p>The bill was in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“A Bill to repeal all acts for the rendition of fugitives from service or
labor.</p>

<p>“<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress
assembled</i>, That all Acts of Congress, or parts of Acts, providing for the
rendition of fugitives from service or labor, be and the same are hereby
repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>March 7th, Mr. Sumner asked the Senate to take up the bill, with a
view to make it the special order for a future day. This motion was
agreed to, and then, on his further motion, it was made the special order
for March 9th. The disposition to delay showed itself the next
day, when Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, proposed to make another question
a special order for the same time. Mr. Sumner reminded him that the
repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act was a special order at that time.
Mr. Davis replied, “I suppose that can wait a little.” Mr. Sumner:
“I do not wish to have that wait at all. It is a disgrace to the country
and the statute-book which we want to get rid of.” When it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>called up at the appointed time, Mr. Davis expressed a desire for postponement,
and then, on motion of Mr. Sumner, at the suggestion of
Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, it was made the special order for March
16th, at one o’clock. Owing to the pendency of an Appropriation Bill,
as unfinished business, on this day, it lost its place.</p>

<p>March 18th, Mr. Sumner, finding that Mr. Davis was not ready to
proceed with his remarks, moved to make the bill the special order for
March 22d, at one o’clock. This motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 20.
Mr. Sumner then said: “I now deem it my duty to give notice that I
shall take every proper occasion to call the bill up, and press its consideration
upon the Senate.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the attention of the Senate was occupied by other things,
especially by the Constitutional Amendment abolishing Slavery.</p>

<p>April 18th, Mr. Sumner appealed to Mr. Fessenden, who had charge
of the Legislative Appropriation Bill, then under consideration, to yield,
so that the other bill could be considered. At this time he said:
“The Senator says it will make a great deal of debate. I doubt if it
will. I think the topic has already been amply discussed in connection
with other matters. I have several times yielded to amiable pressure,
reluctantly, always against my own sense of duty, but from desire to
oblige associates in this body. One Appropriation Bill has been interposed,
on the motion of the Senator from Maine, which has taken
several days. Now, I submit, the time has come when this bill ought
to be considered. Let us give one day to it, at least. I say this with
reluctance, because I see that the Senator has come prepared to go
on with his bill, and I respect so much the order of business and the
preparations of Senators to do their part, that I do not interfere, except
most reluctantly. I am for the Appropriation Bill. The Senator
knows that I am ever in my seat to sustain all his motions on Appropriation
Bills; but this bill is committed to my care, and I therefore
ask him to allow it to be proceeded with to-day. There is in the
Appropriation Bill an innate vitality; it cannot lose by delay; the
public interests cannot suffer; but I do not doubt that all these, and
the good name of the country, suffer by every day’s delay in the
repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act.” Mr. Fessenden said that Mr. Sumner
was “at liberty, if he chose, to move that that bill be taken up
and this be laid aside,” and that he should ask the judgment of the
Senate.</p>

<p>April 19th, Mr. Sumner moved that the Senate proceed with the bill,
and this motion was agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 10. The Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, considered the bill, and it was reported to
the Senate without amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third reading,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>and was read the third time, without a division, and without a
word of debate. It only remained to put the question on its final passage,
when Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, remarked that he was “not prepared
to see this bill passed just now”; he had “supposed the Senator
from Massachusetts was to address the Senate upon it.” Mr. Sumner
had “not the least desire to address the Senate”; he did “not wish to
say a word upon it.” Mr. Foster “did not apprehend that the bill was
to be put on its passage at the present time, and expected to say something
upon it.” Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas, remarked, “We may as well
pass the bill now.” The Chair put the question, and the yeas and
nays were ordered, when Mr. Hendricks spoke against the bill. He
said: “It may be that our fathers erred in the agreement among
themselves that a fugitive slave should be returned; it may be that it
was a mistake on their part; but while their agreement stands, and
while my oath is upon my conscience to respect that agreement, I
cannot vote for a bill like this.” The debate was opened.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, had “some doubt about the expediency of
now repealing the law of 1793.” Mr. Sumner said that the Committee
“felt that we had better make a clean thing, purify the country, and
lift it before foreign nations, which could be only by washing our hands
of Slavery.” Mr. Sherman was “not guided exactly by the motives of
the honorable Senator from Massachusetts”; he would “give to the
people of the Southern States, the few that are left who have the right
to enforce the Constitution against us, their constitutional rights fully
and fairly.” According to him, “the law of 1793 was framed by the
men who framed the Constitution,” and “has been declared to be
valid and constitutional by every tribunal that has acted upon it.”
Mr. Sumner replied, that “it was declared to be unconstitutional in
certain particulars by the Supreme Court of the United States in the
Prigg case, and it is among the records in the life of Judge Story,
who gave the opinion in that case, that the fatal objection of a failure
to give a trial by jury in a case of human freedom was never argued
before the Court, and that he personally considered it an open question.”
Mr. Sherman preferred “not to repeal the law of 1793, about
the constitutionality of which he had little doubt.” Mr. Sumner
replied, “Then the Senator has little doubt that under the Constitution
a human being may be given over to Slavery without a trial by
jury.” Mr. Sherman “would not go into the discussion of that question.”
Finding that the bill had passed the stage when it could be
amended, he moved to reconsider the vote ordering it to be engrossed
and read a third time, which was done, when he moved to add these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Except the Act approved February 12, 1793, entitled ‘An Act respecting
fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their
masters.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, proposed to repeal the Act of 1850,
leaving the Act of 1793 in force. Mr. Sherman thought “we had
better repeal all the laws on the subject except the Act of 1793.” Mr.
Reverdy Johnson said: “The Constitution as it is now, according to
my interpretation of it, not only authorized the passage of the Act of
1793 and the passage of the Act of 1850, but made it the duty of Congress
to pass some law of that description.” Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I shall not be carried into
extended debate, but shall content myself with
replying directly to what has been said on the other
side.</p>

<p>There is, first, the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>],
who intervened to arrest the generous purpose of the
Senate, as it was about to vote, by a motion to preserve
the old Act of 1793. Strange that now, while we are
in deadly conflict with Slavery, it should be proposed
to keep alive an ancient support of Slavery. For the
Senator gravely insists, and the Senator from Maryland
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Reverdy Johnson</span>] insists with him. But the
Senator from Ohio does not seem aware of the character
of the statute he would preserve. Let me remind
him that by this enactment, towards which he is so
tender, a fellow-man may be hurried before a magistrate
and doomed to Slavery without trial by jury.
Can this be constitutional? Will the Senator sanction
such a thing?</p>

<p>Then the other Senator, who is so familiar with our
jurisprudence, takes exception to the statement that
Mr. Justice Story admitted that the constitutionality
of the Act of 1793 had never been affirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Supreme Court. He thinks that this learned judge
never made any such statement. But he is mistaken.
Here is a volume containing the Life and
Letters of Joseph Story, carefully prepared and published
by his son. I turn to the passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One prevailing opinion, which has created great prejudice
against this judgment, is, that it denies the right of a
person claimed as a fugitive from service or labor to a trial
by jury. This mistake arises from supposing the case to involve
the general question as to the constitutionality of the
Act of 1793. But in fact no such question was in the case,
and the argument that the Act of 1793 was unconstitutional,
because it did not provide for a trial by jury according to
the requisitions of the sixth [seventh] article in the Amendments
to the Constitution, having been suggested to my
father, on his return from Washington, <em>he replied, that this
question was not argued by counsel nor considered by the
Court, and that he should still consider it an open one</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Evidently, according to this authentic record by his
son, the necessity of a trial by jury was not argued by
counsel nor considered by the Court, while the judge
for himself declared that he should consider it an
“open” question; so that the constitutionality of the
Act in this important respect has not been affirmed.
But the Senate is now asked to affirm it. We are
asked to vote that a fellow-man be handed over to
Slavery without trial by jury. To me this proposition
is hateful beyond the power of words to express.</p>

<p>But the Senator, not content with affirming the constitutionality
of the Act of 1793, has plunged into a
general discussion on the fugitive clause of the Constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
He insists laboriously that it was intended
to cover fugitive slaves. When I reminded him that
its authors might have intended it to cover fugitive
slaves, without succeeding in their attempt, he still
insists that it does cover fugitive slaves. Well, Sir,
there I meet him point-blank. I insist, that, whatever
the original intention of the framers of that
clause, they did not leave it so as to cover fugitive
slaves. It remains a question of construction, and the
language employed is not applicable to fugitive slaves.
It does not describe them, and cannot by any just
tribunal be extended to embrace them. If the prepossessions
of the Senator were more evenly balanced,
I should not doubt his judgment on this point, which
in the light of jurisprudence is so clear.</p>

<p>There is a rule of interpretation which the Senator
will not call in question. Where any language is
open to two constructions, one beneficent and the
other odious, <em>that which is odious must be rejected</em>. I
do not stop to adduce authorities. The rule is unquestionable,
and the authorities are ample. But keep
in mind the conclusion: that which is odious must be
rejected. Now the Senator has already admitted that
the language of the clause is applicable to apprentices.
Very well. That is enough. In its application to apprentices,
redemptioners, and the like, it is exhausted,
so that it cannot be made to cover a slave without
offending against the rule requiring us to adopt the
construction least odious. And, Sir, if we go further
and closely scan the clause, we find that the words
employed are all applicable to a relation of <em>contract</em>
or <em>debt</em>, and not to a relation founded on <em>force</em>. The
clause is applicable to a “person,” and not to a <em>thing</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and this “person” is to be surrendered on claim of
the person to whom his service or labor may be <em>due</em>.
But, clearly, no labor or service can be <em>due</em> from slave
to master. The whole pretension is an absurdity. And
if you give to this word its legitimate application, you
must restrict it to a case of <em>contract</em> or <em>debt</em>. In this
reply I omit the argument founded on history, and the
well-known opinions of leading minds in the Convention,
confining myself to the text of the Constitution.</p>

<p>But the Senator dwells especially on the words “held
to service or labor in one State <em>under the laws thereof</em>,”
and triumphantly declares that slaves were included
under this language. Here again he is mistaken. Apprentices
and redemptioners were held under “laws”;
but I need not remind the Senator of the admission
repeatedly made on this floor by Mr. Mason, author
of the last Fugitive Slave Act, that there were no
“laws” for Slavery in any Slave State,&mdash;at least,
that none could be produced. Besides, as a jurist, the
Senator surely will recollect the ancient truth, that injustice
cannot be “law,” but is always to be regarded
as an “abuse” or a “violence,” even though expressed
in the form of “law.” In presence of this principle,
which has the sanction of as great a lawyer as St.
Augustine, and in the face of the positive assertion
of Mr. Mason, that no “law” for Slavery can be found
in the Slave States, what becomes of the argument of
the Senator? Sir, the case is clear. No ingenuity
of honest effort can ever make the words cited by the
Senator, or any other words in that much debated
clause, sanction Slavery and the hunting of slaves. To
proceed with his argument, the Senator must begin
by setting aside those commanding rules of interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
which are binding on him as on myself. If,
where words are susceptible of two significations, one
beneficent and the other odious, the former only can be
taken, then must the Senator restrict this clause to that
signification which is not odious. And again, if every
word is always to be construed so as most to favor
Liberty, then must the Senator follow implicitly this
rule. But these two rules make it impossible to torture
the clause into any <em>odious</em> or <em>tyrannical</em> signification.
They keep it clean and pure from Slavery.</p>

<p>Sir, one feels humbled by the necessity of this discussion,&mdash;that
at this late day he should be called to
vindicate the Constitution of his country against glosses
and interpretations in the interest of Slavery. Pardon
me, if, for a moment, leaving the two Senators who seek
to foist Slavery into the Constitution, I turn to the question
itself, not so much for argument as for statement.
If I seem to repeat, it is because there are certain points
which I desire to impress upon the Senate. To my
mind nothing is clearer than that, according to unquestionable
rules of interpretation, the clause of the Constitution,
whatever the alleged intent of its authors, cannot
be considered applicable to slaves. Such is Slavery,
that, from the nature of the case, it cannot be sanctioned
or legalized except by “positive” words. <em>It cannot stand
on inference.</em> This rule, which no reasoning can shake,
drove Lord Mansfield to his great judgment in Somerset’s
case. African Slavery had for two generations prevailed
in England. Eminent lawyers and judges had
pronounced it legal. Some of the brightest names in
Westminster Hall had given to it the support of professional
opinion and the seal of judicial decision. At last
a person at that time unknown, Granville Sharp, struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
by the injustice of Slavery, devoted himself to consider
the grounds on which its legality was recognized. He
studied the laws of England, and all the various evidences
of its Constitution. In the course of these studies
he was gratified to find that there was no <em>positive</em> establishment
of African Slavery in England, and, indeed,
that the words “Slave” and “Slavery” were nowhere to
be found in the British Constitution. He next applied
himself to the powerful array of well-known rules of interpretation,
requiring, in case of doubt or question, that
the interpretation should be on the side of Liberty, and
especially that any man was “impious” and “cruel” who
did not favor Liberty. Impiety and cruelty are not light
burdens for an honest conscience. The conclusion was
irresistible, that Slavery could not exist in England.</p>

<p>But the unanswerable argument of Granville Sharp
was rejected at first by the bar, who regarded it as an
attempted innovation. The direct precedents and the
weight of authority were the other way, and this with
most lawyers is enough. Harvey said that no person
above “forty” accepted his discovery of the circulation
of the blood. And Granville Sharp found himself in
the same predicament. But this good man was not disheartened.
He knew well that there was no statute of
limitations against principles, and, better still, that principles
must finally prevail over precedents. Principles
are immortal, and bloom with perpetual youth: precedents
are mortal, and die from age, decrepitude, and
decay. Against principles precedents may for a while
prevail; but the time comes when that which is mortal
must yield to that which is immortal. In this conviction
he persevered, until at last lawyers were convinced,
and then the court pronounced in his favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The judgment of Lord Mansfield constitutes a landmark
of law, to be remembered proudly, when all his
contributions to commercial law and general jurisprudence
are forgotten. It was a contribution to the British
Constitution and to human rights. Like every principle
of Natural Law, it approves itself at once to the
reason and conscience. And this authority I now invoke
in the interpretation of the Fugitive Clause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have already said too much. The argument on
both sides is presented in the two reports of the Committee,
or rather in the report of the Committee and the
“views of the minority.” Senators, I doubt not, have
already made up their minds, which no discussion can
change. Of course, some may vote against the acts on
one ground and some on another. The arguments are
numerous. It is enough, if on any ground they vote to
remove this shame from our statute-book.</p>

<p>I do not enter into details of the constitutional argument,
whether Congress has power under the Constitution
to legislate on this subject, or whether it may
confide this great trust to a single magistrate without
trial by jury. These are grave questions, worthy of
debate, into which I am ready to enter, if the occasion
requires. But I forbear. Often, in other times, I have
discussed these questions in the Senate and before the
people; but the time for discussion is passed. And
permit me to confess my gladness in this day. I was
chosen to the Senate for the first time immediately
after the passage of the infamous Act of 1850. If at
that election I received from the people of Massachusetts
any special charge, it was to use my best endeavors
to secure the repeal of this atrocity. I began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
work in the first session that I was here. God grant
that I may end it to-day!</p>

<p>Mr. President, one word more. The suggestion is
too often made that this measure is not practical. Not
practical! It is the favorite phrase. But this depends
upon what Senators consider practical.</p>

<p>If it be practical to relieve the people from an unconstitutional
and oppressive statute,&mdash;if it be practical
to take away a badge of subjugation imposed by
slave-masters during a brutal supremacy,&mdash;if it be
practical to secure the good name of the Republic,
still suffering immeasurably from this outrage,&mdash;if it
be practical, at this moment of our own severe trial,
to substitute justice for oppression, and thus secure
the favor of Providence,&mdash;and, finally, if it be practical
to strike at Slavery wherever we can hit it, and
to relieve ourselves of all responsibility for this terrible
wrong,&mdash;then is this measure eminently practical.
It is as practical as justice, as practical as
humanity, as practical as duty, which cannot be postponed.</p>

<p>But, independently of its intrinsic justice, this measure
is recommended by an expediency of the highest
character. I blush to plead in this way, but the occasion
must be my apology. Senators are not aware
how much our country suffers in the judgment of civilized
nations from that accursed statute, which now
for more than ten years has been a byword and hissing
among men. Genius in some of its rarest creations
has made it known, literature and art in every
form have lent themselves to expose it, while the
unutterable atrocities it has sanctioned have been
carefully gathered together and circulated abroad as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
testimony against republican institutions. Since the
outbreak of the Rebellion this statute has been constantly
adduced by our enemies abroad, as showing
that we are no better than Jefferson Davis and his
slavemonger crew; for Slavery never shows itself worse
than in the slave-hunter. Only within a few days
there has appeared at New York, published for the
fair, a photograph copy of a letter of the late Alexander
von Humboldt, containing the following words:
“I have the warmest attachment to your beautiful and
liberal city, New York, but have earnestly and deeply
regretted that Webster, whom I long respected, more
than favored that <em>shameful</em> law which still persecuted
colored men after they had regained by flight their natural,
inborn liberty, of which they had been robbed by
Christians.” Humboldt was our friend, but he could
not forbear characterizing this statute as “shameful.”
Be assured, Sir, it is a burden for the national cause
abroad which it ought not to bear. For the sake of
our cause, and that it may have new strength in the
swelling sympathies of the civilized world, it should be
repealed at once, without hesitation.</p>

<p>I confess, Sir, another motive. At this moment of
severe trial, I wish my country to put itself right with
that Supreme Power which holds in its hands the destinies
of nations. It is as true in the life of nations
as in the life of individuals, that, if you would have
equity, you must do equity; but the great equity which
we must do is found in justice to an oppressed race.
It is vain that you complain of disaster to your arms,
of colored soldiers and their brave officers cruelly
treated at Fort Wagner, of colored soldiers and their
brave officers massacred at Fort Pillow, if yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
continue to set the example of injustice. The story
of the Israelites is revived, and plague after plague is
sent, sounding forever the old commandment, “Let
my people go.” If the plagues sent already are not
enough, another and yet another will visit us. There
is one assurance of obedience which you can give. It
is to expunge from your statute-book all support of
Slavery. Be in earnest here, and you will be practical.
Then, having done equity, you may fearlessly ask for
equity.</p>

<p>I have already said more than I intended. It was
my purpose to leave the Senate without a word of argument
or persuasion. The case to my mind is too clear,
and I thought the time had come for votes. And now,
as I conclude, I forbear to press all constitutional objections,
and present the whole question on a single ground.
Slavery has struck at the national life. Let us strike
back wherever we can smite the great offender, and
above all let us purify the statute-book, so that there
shall be nothing there out of which this terrible wrong
can derive support. In the discharge of this duty, all
Fugitive Acts should be repealed. The argument
against one is the same against all.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sherman was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 24, Nays 17.</p>

<p>Mr. Saulsbury moved an amendment of two sections concerning arrests
without due process of law,&mdash;Yeas 9, Nays 27. Mr. Conness, of
California, then said: “I do not wish to cast a vote for this measure in
its present shape. I had intended, before the debate closed, if it was
debated, to say something on the subject. I do not design that now; and
as the Senate have seen fit to amend the bill, I cannot vote for it. At
present, therefore, I move that it lie on the table.” Mr. Sumner hoped
the Senator would “withdraw that motion.” Mr. Conness: “For what
reason?” Mr. Sumner: “For the reason that we get something by this
bill.” The motion to lay on the table was lost,&mdash;Yeas 9, Nays 31. The
Democrats, and Mr. Conness, voted in the affirmative.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>April 20th, the Senate proceeded with the bill, when Mr. Foster, of
Connecticut, made an elaborate speech, especially vindicating the Act
of 1793, in the course of which he was frequently interrupted by Mr.
Sumner in answer to points of the argument. He was followed by Mr.
Gratz Brown, of Missouri, who concluded by saying: “I cannot support
this bill as it has been amended. I cannot support any bill that
recognizes as right and proper any Fugitive Slave Act; and I shall
therefore refuse to give it my sanction, if it comes to a vote upon the
final passage in its present shape.”</p>

<p>April 21st, Mr. Van Winkle, of West Virginia, seized the opportunity
to speak at length on the question of the war. Mr. Howard, of Michigan,
moved an amendment at the end of the bill:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But no person found in any Territory of the United States, or in the District
of Columbia, shall be deemed to have been held to labor or service, or
to be a slave; nor shall he or she be removed under said Act of 1793; and
the fourth section of said Act is hereby repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, moved an executive session. Mr. Sumner
suggested that it should be an hour later. Mr. Brown thought the
bill could not be finished that evening. Mr. Fessenden did not like to
interfere with this bill, but he must give notice, that, if the bill were
not disposed of that afternoon, or by one o’clock the next day, he must
then move to go on with the Army Appropriation Bill. Mr. Sumner
hoped “we might go on for at least another hour.” Mr. Conness “did
not understand the anxiety of his honorable friend from Massachusetts
in pressing this bill in its present condition.” Mr. Pomeroy hoped Mr.
Sumner would let the bill go over; there were half a dozen amendments
to be proposed. Mr. Sumner replied: “Very well; if the friends of the
measure request that it shall not be pressed to-day, I will not throw
myself in their way.” Accordingly, on the motion of Mr. Conness, it
was postponed to April 27th, and made the special order at one o’clock;
but it was then superseded by the unfinished business of the day preceding,
being the National Currency. With the amendment fastened upon
his bill, keeping alive the Act of 1793, Mr. Sumner was not encouraged
to press it, and he waited the action of the House of Representatives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 6th, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Morris, of New York,
reported from the Committee on the Judiciary a bill in the following
terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">An Act</span> to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act of eighteen hundred and fifty,
and all Acts and Parts of Acts for the Rendition of Fugitive Slaves.</p>

<p>“<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled</i>,
That sections three and four of an Act entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> ‘An Act respecting
fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters,’
passed February twelve, seventeen hundred and ninety-three, and an
Act entitled ‘An Act to amend, and supplementary to, the Act entitled “An
Act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service
of their masters,” passed February twelve, seventeen hundred and ninety-three,’
passed September, eighteen hundred and fifty, be, and the same are,
hereby repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>After some skirmishing, the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read
a third time. It was then vehemently denounced, and a series of motions
was made to delay or stave off its passage. At last Mr. Morris
allowed its postponement to June 13th, on which day, after further
denunciation, it passed the House,&mdash;Yeas 90, Nays 62.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 15th, the House bill was laid before the Senate, when Mr. Sumner
said: “I am instructed by the Committee on Slavery and Freedmen
to move the immediate passage of that bill. The Senate understands it;
the House of Representatives has acted on it; there is no need of debate;
and I ask to have it voted on at once.” Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire,
objected, as he wanted the morning hour for morning business.
Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, moved its reference to the Committee on the
Judiciary. Mr. Sumner wished it referred to the Committee on Slavery
and Freedmen. The Senate refused to order the reference to the Committee
on the Judiciary,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 21. Then, on motion of Mr.
Sumner, it was referred to the other Committee. Mr. Sumner, anticipating
such a reference, had already obtained from the Committee authority
to report it promptly, without amendment, which he did at
once, and asked for immediate action. Objection being made, the bill
was not considered at that time.</p>

<p>June 21st, Mr. Sumner moved that the Senate proceed with the
House bill, which, after earnest debate, was ordered,&mdash;Yeas 25, Nays
17. The Senate then took a recess till evening, when other business
was considered, including the question of opening the street cars.</p>

<p>June 22d, Mr. Sumner moved to proceed with the House bill. Mr.
Hale, of New Hampshire, opposed the motion, as he desired the Senate
to take up some naval bills. The motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 22.
In the evening session, Mr. Sumner moved again to proceed with the
House bill. Mr. Chandler said: “I will spend to-night with great
pleasure with the Senator from Massachusetts on his bill; but to-morrow
I shall demand the day for the Committee on Commerce.” Mr.
Saulsbury moved to adjourn, saying, “Let us have one day without
the nigger.” The motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 28. Mr. Reverdy
Johnson wished to secure an opportunity for Mr. Davis to speak, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>was now absent. Mr. Sumner replied: “The Senator from Kentucky
has had ample notice. He knew that this bill would be moved as soon
as I could get the floor.” Mr. Johnson insisted, when Mr. Sumner
said: “The public business cannot wait. Again and again has this
measure been postponed in deference to the Senator from Kentucky.”
The motion to proceed with the bill was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 12.
Mr. Lane, of Indiana, then moved to proceed with executive business.
Mr. Powell said: “You cannot get a vote to-night.” Mr. Sumner:
“Let us try.” Mr. McDougall: “It is not possible to take a vote to-night.”
Mr. Howard and Mr. Wade: “We can get it by morning.”
Mr. McDougall: “It cannot be done.” The motion for an executive
session was lost,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 22. Mr. Saulsbury then moved that
the bill be indefinitely postponed, and the question resulted, Yeas 11,
Nays 25. Mr. Lane again moved an executive session, which motion
was lost,&mdash;Yeas 16, Nays 22. Mr. Powell then moved that the bill
be postponed until the first Monday of December next. Pending this
motion, Mr. Riddle, of Delaware, moved an adjournment, which was
lost,&mdash;Yeas 12, Nays 22. In the course of these dilatory motions, Mr.
Sherman remarked that he was willing to give Mr. Davis an opportunity
to be heard, and then said: “If Senators propose to resort to
these parliamentary tactics, these interminable propositions for delay,
merely to defeat a vote upon a bill which the majority have a right to
pass, I am perfectly willing now to go into a contest of physical endurance.”
At last the bill was reported to the Senate without amendment,
with the understanding that Mr. Davis should be heard upon it
the next day, when Mr. Powell withdrew his motion, and, after the
consideration of executive business, the Senate adjourned.</p>

<p>June 23d, Mr. Davis addressed the Senate at length. Mr. Saulsbury
moved to strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the
words of the Constitution concerning fugitives from service, with the
addition: “And Congress shall pass all necessary and proper laws for
the rendition of all such persons who shall so as aforesaid escape.” The
motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 9, Nays 29. Mr. Johnson moved to amend
the bill so as to keep alive the Act of 1793, saying: “The amendment,
as the Senate will see, makes this bill like the one that we passed
after debate.” This motion was also lost,&mdash;Yeas 17, Nays 22. So the
Senate reversed its former decision on that question. The bill was
then passed by the vote, Yeas 27, Nays 12, and was approved by the
President June 28th.</p>

<p>Here was the end of all Fugitive Slave Acts, and another blow at
Slavery.</p>

<p>April 26th, the Senate having under consideration the bill to provide
a National Currency secured by a pledge of United States bonds,
and to provide for the circulation and redemption thereof, the Committee
on Finance reported an amendment to strike out this clause,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent the taxation by
States of the capital stock of banks organized under this Act, the same as
the property of other moneyed corporations, for State or municipal purposes;
but no State shall impose any tax upon such associations, or their capital,
circulation, dividends, or business, at a higher rate of taxation than shall be
imposed by such State upon the same amount of moneyed capital in the
hands of individual citizens of such State: <i>Provided</i>, That no State tax shall
be imposed on any part of the capital stock of such association invested in
the bonds of the United States, deposited as security for its circulation,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and insert instead thereof another clause, which, after providing for
payments to the Treasurer of the United States “in lieu of all other
taxes,” further declared,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent the
market value of the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person
or body corporate, from being included in the valuation of the personal
property of such person or corporation in the assessment of all taxes imposed
by or under State authority for State or other purposes, but not at a greater
rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual
citizens of such State; and all the remedies provided by State laws for the
collection of such taxes shall be applicable thereto: <i>Provided, also</i>, That
nothing in this Act shall exempt the real estate of associations from either
State, county, or municipal taxes, to the same extent, according to its
value, as other real estate is taxed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner saw in the report of the Committee a deference to the
State banks which he feared might imperil the national system, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>he made an effort to secure for the national banks the largest immunity,
believing it important to the national credit.</p>

<p>Early in the debate he spoke,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and Mr. Fessenden replied to him.</p>

<p>April 27th, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This question seems to me
very simple. The country is now engaged in
mortal struggle to establish itself as a nation. It has
gone forth to meet Rebellion organized in the name of
State Rights. In preparing ourselves for this unparalleled
contest, we are compelled to look about in every
direction to increase our army, to enlarge our navy, and
to multiply our financial resources; but at every stage
we are encountered by objections in the name of State
Rights. No single proposition is brought forward, having
for object the salvation of the Republic by infusing
new energy and new vitality, which is not encountered
in the name of State Rights. And now, Sir, while
considering how to secure financial stability, we are
doomed again to encounter the oft-repeated objection.
The Rebellion began in State Rights, and all opposition
to the measures conceived to crush it is in the name of
State Rights. It is hard that we should be obliged to
meet State Rights not only on the battle-field, but also
in this Chamber.</p>

<p>The Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>] complained
that it was proposed to sequester so large an amount of
property from State taxation. The sum-total of property
thus sequestered is $300,000,000<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>; but has the Senator
considered how much is sequestered by other agencies
to save this Republic? There is the army with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
material of war, there is the navy with all the material
of the navy,&mdash;all sequestered. Who complains that this
vast material, now counted far beyond $300,000,000, is
sequestered from State taxation? Does any Senator,
in the name of State Rights, claim that the enlarged
navy of the Republic, as it floats into a Northern port,
shall be brought within the sphere of local taxation,
whether State or municipal? Does any Senator say
that all the vast material of war, ammunition, cannon,
and the like, deposited, for the time being, in any particular
locality, shall fall within the sphere of State or
municipal taxation? Or does any Senator insist that
the public securities shall be left exposed to State taxation?
No Senator makes any such complaint. But
the complaint is reserved for the present occasion, when
it is proposed to create a new agency for the currency
of the country.</p>

<p>I know not how the exemption can be sanctioned in
one case and not in the other. The reason applicable to
one is applicable to the other. It is said that the army
and navy are for war, and naturally share exemptions
incident to war and its preparations. But it would be
difficult to say, that, in this crisis, what you do for the
finances is not essentially a war measure, entitled to all
the consideration accorded to such measures in a moment
of war. What are your army and navy without
a Treasury? Milton, in one of his sublimest sonnets,
has aptly pictured that statesmanship which was able</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these few words the very likeness is given. All who
hear them will confess their truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Sir, no Senator complains because we protect the
nerve of iron; but the Senator from Vermont registers
complaints because it is proposed to protect the much
more delicate nerve of gold. What is worth doing is
worth well doing; and if it be worth while to organize
the finances of this Republic by the proposed banking
system, it is worth while to do it well; and can you do
it well, if, at the very moment of its organization, you
leave its most sensitive part exposed to hostile influence?</p>

<p>The precedent for this exemption is complete. Already
you exempt the public stocks and securities from
local taxation. Pray, Sir, tell me what policy justifies
such exemption which is not equally strong for the
exemption of shares in the national banks. Clearly, it
was to commend your national stocks that you established
the exemption; and for the same reason I ask
you now to establish this other exemption. It is strange
that the vast sequestration of the national stocks from
State taxation should have been made with so little
doubt, when Senators question so pertinaciously this
smaller sequestration. If it was proper in one case, it
is in the other. If it was necessary in one case, it is in
the other.</p>

<p>If you allow the State to interfere with the proposed
system by taxation in any way, may they not embarrass
it? Where shall they stop? Where will you run a
line? Undoubtedly, according to the Supreme Court,
they cannot tax the bank directly. This would be unconstitutional.
But it is said that they may tax the
shares. Now I raise no constitutional question. It
may be that a tax on shares is constitutional. But I
shall not consider it on this ground. I am now arguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
against the policy of such tax. It is a question of expediency
which I raise, for the sake of the system we
are about to establish. But here the rule seems clear.
Every consideration urged against taxing the bank directly
may be urged against taxing the shares. If it be
bad policy in one case, it must be in the other.</p>

<p>I suppose there is no judgment of our Supreme Court
which has been more admired than that in the case of
<i>M’Culloch</i> v. <i>The State of Maryland</i>.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> It was pronounced
by Chief Justice Marshall, and is as good a
specimen of that “pure reason” which belonged to this
magistrate as any that can be named. In the course of
this elaborate judgment all the topics were considered
which enter so peculiarly into this debate. It was there
insisted that the tax was unconstitutional. But the
words of the Chief Justice seem intended for the present
occasion. His object, from beginning to end, was to
keep the bank safe from the hostile acts of the States.
It was a great effort to uphold a national institution
against State Rights. It was, permit me to say, an answer
in advance to the Senator from Vermont. I do
not like to trouble the Senate, but there are passages
so pertinent that I will read them. Here, for instance,
the Chief Justice considers the ground of exemption.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then proceeded at some length to analyze the judgment
of Chief Justice Marshall, reading important parts of it; and he then
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sir, every consideration, every argument, which
goes to sustain this great judgment, may be employed
against the proposed concession to the States of the
power to tax this national institution in any particular,
whether directly or indirectly. The reason of the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
is as strong against an indirect tax as against a
direct tax.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After showing the character of the new system as an instrument of
national credit, as the Navy-Yard and the Mint are instruments for
the public service, he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The very measure under consideration seeks to create
a new currency by a system of national banks which
shall supersede the existing State banks as agents of
currency. Of course the new system must begin in
rivalry with the State banks, which in many cases will
be hostile. This is no inconsiderable impediment. But
this impediment will be increased, if the national banks
be exposed to local taxation. It is an untried experiment
upon which you are entering. On every account
it should be made under the most favorable circumstances,&mdash;precisely
as when we put stock in the market.
The national banks should be commended in every possible
way. But, instead, it is proposed to fasten upon
them a liability, which, if it do not cause people to
avoid them, will at least keep them in rivalry with the
State banks, so that the new system cannot become
truly effective. It seems to me that there is but one
practical course. Naturally, all who are against the
proposed system will favor any limitation or burden to
impair its efficiency. But all who are for the system,
and wish to see it doing all the good it can, will take
care that it is not compelled to carry weight. The
whole case may be briefly summed up. Would you
place the national credit on a sure foundation? Are
you for the national banks as a proper agency to this
end? If these two objects interest you, then, I say, do
not allow them to be sacrificed in subserviency to State
Rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden followed in an earnest speech, vindicating the report
of the Committee, to which Mr. Sumner replied.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The debate continued
for several days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>May 5th, as a substitute for the amendment of the Committee, Mr.
Sumner moved the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In lieu of all other taxes on the capital, circulation, deposits, shares,
and other property, every association shall pay to the Treasurer of the
United States, in the months of January and July, a duty of one per cent
each half-year from and after the first day of January, 1864, upon the average
amount of its notes in circulation, and a duty of one half of one per
cent each half-year upon the average amount of its deposits, and a duty of
one half of one per cent each half-year, as aforesaid, on the average amount
of its capital stock beyond the amount invested in United States bonds; and
in case of default in the payment thereof by any association, the duties
aforesaid may be collected in the manner provided for the collection of
United States duties of other corporations, or the Treasurer may reserve
the amount of such duties out of the interest as it may become due on the
bonds deposited with him by such defaulting association. And each association
shall, within ten days from the first days of January and July of each
year, make a return, under the oath of its president or cashier, to the Treasurer
of the United States, in such form as he may prescribe, of the average
amount of its notes in circulation, and of the average amount of its deposits,
and of the average amount of its capital stock beyond the amount invested
in United States bonds, for the six months next preceding the first days of
January and July, as aforesaid; and in default of such return, and for each
default thereof, each defaulting association shall forfeit and pay to the
United States the sum of two hundred dollars, to be collected either out of
the interest as it may become due to such association on the bonds deposited
with the Treasurer, or, at his option, in the manner in which penalties
are to be collected of other corporations under the laws of the United
States; and in case of such default, the amount of the duties to be paid by
such association shall be assessed upon the amount of notes delivered to
such association by the Comptroller of the Currency, and upon the highest
amount of its deposits and capital stock, to be ascertained in such other
manner as the Treasurer may deem best. <i>Provided</i>, That nothing in this
Act shall exempt the real estate of associations from either State, county,
or municipal taxes, to the same extent, according to its value, as other real
estate is taxed: <i>Provided, also</i>, That all taxes imposed by this or any future
Act on banking associations organized under national legislation shall be
applied exclusively to the payment of the interest and principal of the
national debt of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>It will be perceived that the special object of this amendment was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>to keep the taxation of the national banks in the hands of the National
Government. In this aim Mr. Sumner was sustained by Mr. Chase,
the Secretary of the Treasury, who, in a communication to the Chairman
of the Senate Committee of Finance, May 9, 1864, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under ordinary circumstances there might be no insuperable objection
to leaving the property organized under the national banking law subject,
as are almost all descriptions of property, to general taxation, State, national,
and municipal; but, in the present condition of the country, I respectfully
submit that this particular description of property should be
placed in the same category with imported goods before entry into general
consumption, and be subjected to exclusive national taxation.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner spoke in the same vein.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;At last, in this discussion, it is
clear that we have come to the place where the road
branches in two opposite directions: one toward the
support of the whole country, and of that improved
currency essential not only to the general welfare, but
also to the common defence; and the other toward State
rights, State taxation, and State banks. Which road
will you take, Sir?</p>

<p>Or, stating the case in a different way, it is a question
between the national credit, involving the interests of
all, on the one side, and certain local pretensions on the
other side. It is a question between the whole and
a part,&mdash;between the life of the Republic and a small
percentage of taxation which Senators claim for their
States. The enemy is at our gates,&mdash;gold is at 180,&mdash;and
yet Senators hesitate.</p>

<p>All are watching, at this moment, the movement of
our forces under General Grant, and are longing for victory.
Nothing that the country can do to make him
strong is left undone. Men, money, supplies, everything
is lavished; and only the day before yesterday
the Senate voted another $25,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another field, where the battle is bloodless,
but scarcely less important: I mean the field of
finance. If our pecuniary resources fail, it is doubtful
if the army and navy must not fail also. But victory
on this field would give triumphant strength and vigor
to all the operations of Government. There is no argument
for the army and navy&mdash;ay, Sir, for the present
support of the Lieutenant-General of the United States,
in the field at the head of our military forces&mdash;which
at this moment is not equally applicable to the support
of the Secretary of the Treasury at the head of our
<em>financial forces</em>.</p>

<p>How different the treatment of these two officers!
Everything is given to the one, almost without debate;
but little is given to the other without higgling at every
stage.</p>

<p>There are movements pending in the field of national
finance hardly less important than those in the
field of war. A defeat in finance would be little less
disastrous than a defeat in war.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, and at this critical moment,
a measure is brought forward whose real character
is discerned in its title: “<em>To provide a national currency</em>
secured by a pledge of United States bonds, and to provide
for the circulation and redemption thereof.” The
primary object of this bill is not, therefore, to establish
national banks, but to secure the national currency.
For the sake of the currency a system of national banks
is to be established; they are the means to the end.
But the end sought is an improved currency. Sir, this
must not be forgotten. If it were a mere question of a
national bank, if it were a question between two rival
systems, Senators might take sides. But who will hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
to give all that is needed, even all that is asked by
the proper authorities, for an improved currency? You
may seem to give much, when you abandon sources of
State taxation; but you can give nothing that will not
be returned tenfold, a hundred-fold, when the currency
at last becomes fixed and uniform.</p>

<p>Glance only for a moment at the incalculable advantages
of a sound currency. Gold will assume its
normal place, business will be sure, values will be
fixed, fluctuations will cease, inflated prices will pass
away. There is not a mart of commerce, there is not
a village in the whole country, that will not feel the
change. But this great boon cannot be assured without
corresponding effort. Like victory in the field of battle,
it must be fought for and paid for.</p>

<p>And now, when victory seems within reach, when an
improved currency is already begun, Senators hesitate
in conceding those facilities without which victory is
doubtful. They set up claims for their States, and insist
upon certain rights of taxation. If this were a
season of peace, I could appreciate the pretension;
but when I consider the peril of the country, filling
us all with such anxiety,&mdash;when I consider that its
very being is assailed, and that it is to be defended on
the field of finance just as much as on the field of battle,&mdash;I
feel that every endeavor to hamper the pending
measure differs little in character from an effort to hamper
our soldiers in the field. We spare nothing essential
to our armies; we should spare nothing essential to
our currency. Men and money both are necessary;
both must be cherished and protected with equal patriotic
care.</p>

<p class="center">…<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I am unwilling to be misunderstood. I have no
feeling except of kindness for the State banks, especially
when they keep within the proper sphere of banks, and
do not undertake to supply a currency for the country.
But at this moment, when we are seeking to create a
new currency, which shall be the foundation of national
credit, and of national character too, I confess that I
have little sympathy with anything that puts itself in
the way. The State banks have performed their task as
agents of currency, and the time has come for them to
abdicate,&mdash;or, if they do not abdicate, at least to conform
to the new system.</p>

<p>I do not stop to inquire if any paper issued by State
banks as currency can be constitutional,&mdash;to consider
if the States, which cannot coin money, can yet put paper
in circulation as money. I content myself with insisting,
that, whatever the constitutional merits of this
question, it is no longer expedient that States should be
invested with the power. We must have another system.
The best interests of the whole country require
it, especially at this time of national peril.</p>

<p>It is clear that the State banks are not competent to
meet the crisis. They cannot do the business required.
Besides, they are in the way. Putting their notes in
circulation almost at will, the currency is inflated beyond
control. Depreciation naturally ensues. Bankruptcy
may follow.</p>

<p>When I say that the State banks are in the way, I do
not use too strong language. Authentic tables show the
extent to which during the last year the currency has
been affected by their interference. I hold in my hand
a statement from the Bank Reports for 1862, page 208,
and for 1863, page 210. At the risk of wearying the
Senate, I will read it.</p>

<p>These tables speak. They show the range within
which the State banks undertake to operate, and their
consequent interference with the national system. If it
be said that in certain parts of the country, as in New
England and New York, the State banks have performed
good service, I reply, that, even admitting all that is
claimed, the service is local and incomplete. It does
not embrace the West.</p>

<p>The present endeavor is to provide a remedy for this
trouble by a comprehensive national system, discharging
the function performed by the State banks, and embracing
the whole country. It is called national because
it belongs to the nation, and not to any particular
State, and because its origin, aim, and inspiration are all
national. It is conceived in no hostility or unkindness
to the State banks, but in a patriotic purpose to do what
can be done to secure what all desire,&mdash;a national currency.
The State banks will be welcome to a place in
the system, like State troops coming forward for the
defence of the Republic; but they cannot be tolerated,
if they stand aloof, or refuse to take the post assigned
them. At a moment of peril, when the Government
is bending all its energies to save the national currency,
a mutiny among State banks will be hardly
less disastrous than a mutiny among State troops.
Every murmur or mutter of such mutiny ought to be
repressed at once. All should be summoned to perfect
and harmonious coöperation in that cause which
embraces the whole country, in every walk of life,
whether military or civil.</p>

<p>I know not how others are impressed, but to my
mind it is difficult to imagine anything, short of those
everlasting principles of human freedom involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
this war, which should at this moment be more carefully
watched than the currency of the country. Let
this be safe, and everything will be safe,&mdash;army, navy,
and the whole national cause. Such a currency will
constitute an epoch in the history of the country,&mdash;ay,
Sir, in the history of the world. There have been
ministers in other countries and other times whose
names are immortal from association with commercial
reforms. Colbert was the founder of the commercial
system of France; Peel was the founder of free trade
in England. But the present Secretary of the Treasury,
when the new system is at last triumphant over all
obstacles, including the mutiny of State banks and the
lukewarmness of Senators, may boast that he has given
a currency to his country. Next after the great gift of
human freedom there is nothing greater he could give,&mdash;nothing
that comes home so completely to the business
and bosoms of the people, rich and poor, throughout
our wide-spread empire. An improved currency
is like sunshine, penetrating every corner of the land,
under which commerce, business, comfort, civilization,
life itself, will put forth blossom and fruit. Nobody
in the community too high, nobody too low, not to feel
the new-found boon filling every household and travelling
on every highway. But it is seen now in another
aspect. An improved currency is like a new levy of
national troops, a new navy afloat, a new contribution
of supplies. It is the herald and assurance of untold
success. In itself it is a present daily victory,&mdash;fruitful
parent of victory everywhere.</p>

<p>Such is the object proposed,&mdash;important at any
time, inconceivably important at this moment. And
the question recurs, Are you for a national, life-giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
currency, or are you for the State banks? You cannot
be for both; one must yield to the other. If you are
for the former, you must abandon the State banks, or
compel them to enlist in the national cause.</p>

<p>Massachusetts&mdash;which has a larger bank capital in
proportion to her population than any other State, and,
moreover, looks to taxation of this capital as a chief
source of income&mdash;has already, by her patriotic Governor,
volunteered support to the national banks.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner quoted from the Address of Governor Andrew to
the Legislature of Massachusetts, January 9, 1863.</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the testimony of Massachusetts, by the lips
of her brave Chief Magistrate. Seeing the object before
us, he raises no question of State rights, presents
no claim of State taxation, makes no plea for State
banks.</p>

<p>Sir, it is vain to think that you can keep both systems
at the same time. One must yield to the other.
But if you sincerely desire the national system to prevail,
then must you so endow and protect it that it will
be commended to the public, and that investments will
naturally seek it. Therefore every privilege you confer,
every immunity you give, every exemption you
establish in its favor, must naturally contribute to its
strength, and make it more effective for its transcendent
purposes.</p>

<p>This is the day of sacrifice. Families are offering
sons and brothers. States are giving their citizens, and
every citizen is contributing according to his means
to the safety of the Republic. But there is one other
sacrifice now required: it is the sacrifice of the State
banks as agents of currency; and this sacrifice requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
that the local taxation should be suspended with regard
to the national currency, and that all the proceeds of
such local taxation should be passed to the credit of the
whole country. You must do for the national currency
precisely what you do for the national securities. Here
are the words of the statute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And all stock, bonds, and other securities of the United
States, held by individuals, corporations, or associations, within
the United States, <em>shall be exempt from taxation by or under
State authority</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The reason which sustains the exemption in this case
is equally applicable in the other.</p>

<p>But we have other exemptions from local taxation.</p>

<p>There are the imports of the country, which no State
or municipality can tax.</p>

<p>There are the army and navy, and all the material of
war,&mdash;ships, arms, munitions, commissariat supplies,&mdash;all
exempt from local taxation.</p>

<p>There are the public lands of the United States, which
no local authority can touch.</p>

<p>There is the Mint, which is untaxed.</p>

<p>There are the public buildings in Washington, the
National Capitol, the Executive Mansion, the offices
of the heads of Departments, covering large spaces of
ground, all secured from local taxation.</p>

<p>But no reason can be assigned for exemption in these
cases that does not prevail with regard to the currency.
Nay, at this juncture, when our object is, above all
things, to secure a national currency, the reason for
exemption is of special and unanswerable force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>We have more than once been warned not to slay the
goose that lays the golden egg,&mdash;meaning by this goose
the State banks. But all who use this illustration forget
that there is another bird, which lays such eggs as
no State banks can hatch,&mdash;eggs not merely of gold,
but of victory. It is the <em>national credit</em>, which Senators
seem willing to abandon, if not to slay; and it
is the national credit which I now insist shall be preserved
at all hazards.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I was not a sharer in the counsels
that originated this measure. Had I been consulted,
I know not that I should have originally advised the
experiment in its actual form. Clearly, something was
necessary for the sake of the currency, and for the sake
of the country; and after proper consideration the present
system was adopted. Operations under it have already
commenced; $60,000,000 of capital have been
organized according to its requirements. It is too late
to retreat. It only remains that you should go forward,
not sluggishly, heavily, reluctantly, but bravely, confidently.
The financial enterprise already begun must
be finished and protected. Here I cannot hesitate. If
the system is to be maintained, if it is not to be utterly
abandoned, it must be placed under the most favorable
auspices, so at least that it may not fail from any want
of care on our part. It should be made strong in itself,
and then it should be surrounded with an atmosphere
congenial and friendly. For this reason I shall vote
to keep it free from all State hostility and even State
rivalry, that it may become in reality, as in name,
wholly national.</p>

<p>Sir, I am told that it will be unpopular to make this
sacrifice, and ancient ghosts are paraded through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Chamber to frighten us from duty. Naturally, all who
are against the proposed system will be against the
seeming sacrifice. But the people are too intelligent
not to see what is demanded by the best interests of the
national currency; and unless I greatly err, they will
insist that what we do shall be so done as to make our
work most effective and most triumphant, to the end
that victory may be certain. It is on no narrow ground
that I make my appeal. I speak for a national currency
which shall be to the whole country like the
horn of abundance; and I plead for it now, as essential
not only to the general welfare, but also to the
common defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Fessenden replied to Mr. Sumner with severity. On the other
hand, Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, recognized as a business man, said:
“The country owes the Senator from Massachusetts a debt of gratitude
for his patriotism and statesmanship. He has risen above small matters,
above local, petty interests, and has come up to the standard of
the broadest statesmanship, in the argument he has just delivered,
which is one of the ablest financial arguments ever delivered on this
floor.”</p>

section establishing an Assay Office at Dalles City, and insert several
sections establishing a Branch Mint there, instead. This was contrary
to the recommendation of the Finance Committee, and also to communications
from Mr. Pollock, the Director of the Mint at Philadelphia,
and Mr. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, sustained by Mr. Fessenden
in the Senate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>April 29th, Mr. Sumner spoke.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;When this subject was under
consideration before, I voted with the Committee,
partly because it is my habit to vote with committees
on matters within their special consideration, and partly
because at the time I was under the impression that
their report was justified by correct principles. Subsequent
reflection has induced me to hesitate in this
conclusion.</p>

<p>Much dependence has been placed upon the report of
the Director of the mint at Philadelphia. Now, Sir, if
he had contented himself with giving an opinion against
establishing a mint in Oregon, without assigning reasons,
I might have respected his opinion; but when he
puts forward as his first great objection that the multiplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of mints will tend to “national disintegration,”
I confess that I join with the Senator from Oregon [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Nesmith</span>] in distrusting his conclusion. What confidence
can anybody have in anything founded on such
premises, which experience, if not reason, shows to be
false? Why, Sir, the author of this opinion forgets that
in the country most centralized in the world, where all
the agencies of Government converge in a single capital,&mdash;I
mean France,&mdash;there have been for a long time,
even within its comparatively contracted borders, more
than half a dozen different mints. Besides a magnificent
central mint at Paris, there are, or were very recently,
auxiliary mints at Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Lille,
Rouen, and Strasbourg. I never heard that this multiplicity
tended toward “national disintegration.” France
still continues one and indivisible; and I doubt if there
would be any difference in this respect, even if there
were a mint in every one of her eighty-six Departments.
Really, the Director of the Philadelphia mint ought to
have borne in mind the famous instructions of Lord
Mansfield to the colonial magistrate, and contented
himself with an opinion without assigning reasons.</p>

<p>There is a different consideration, to which I confess
that I am not insensible. It is the importance of a
correct and finished coinage, which it seems natural to
suppose best promoted by a single mint. On this point
I am disposed to agree with the Director. But our
Government has not acted on this principle.</p>

<p>If circumstances favored the consolidation of the
national coinage at a single mint, I can conceive that
there would be advantages of an unquestionable character.
Indeed, if we repair to France, where the mints
have been in times past so numerous, we find that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
advantages have not been denied. I suppose that the
most authoritative testimony on this subject, whether
we look at it in the light of theory or of practice, is
found in that country; and if we seek special authorities,
there is nothing so instructive or ample as the report
of Dumas and De Colmont, made in 1839, under a
commission from the French Minister of Finance. This
document, with its minute disclosures on the operations
of mints, was for some time kept secret in France. I
have understood that only <em>twelve copies</em> were printed for
the use of the Commission, who were placed under a
solemn obligation not to divulge it. But I believe it
found its way to publicity at the time of the Parliamentary
inquiry into the Mint in 1849, which resulted
in a valuable blue-book.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dumas is for a single mint. He
dwells especially on two considerations,&mdash;economy, and
the perfection of the coinage; and these he places above
local interests demanding multiplicity of mints. The
figures by which he illustrates the superior economy are
very striking. <em>These assume that the metal is already delivered
at the mint</em>,&mdash;a point not to be forgotten on the
present occasion. Beyond his own opinion on the question
of perfection, Dumas quotes the testimony of Basterrèche,
Regent of the Bank of France, who, after an
examination of the subject as long ago as 1800, very
positively declared that “the perfection of labor which
ought to distinguish a great nation imperiously required
a single mint, placed under the immediate superintendence
of the Government.” And he also quotes the testimony
of Humann, Minister of Finance, who, in presenting
his budget in 1835, declared that the Paris
mint was adequate to do all the coinage required in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
France,&mdash;that the concentration of labor there would
promote improvement in the processes of production,&mdash;that
in this way the Government would be relieved
from the expense of different establishments,&mdash;that all
the money from the same mint would be identical in
character, and in proportion as it acquired perfection
would be less exposed to counterfeiting,&mdash;and, in fine,
that the superintendence of the Government would be
a guaranty of security, which does not exist where the
work is distributed in a large number of establishments.
Such was the testimony of the minister, adopted by the
illustrious authority in science, Dumas. Perhaps the
case could not be stated stronger. Yet it did not prevail
in 1800, when it was first given,&mdash;nor in 1835,
nor in 1839,&mdash;even in France, where the tendency to
concentration is so active, where the facilities for it are
so great, and the disposition to take counsel of science
is so confirmed. And surely there must be a reason
why it did not prevail.</p>

<p>Dumas says, in rather contemptuous phrase, that
“on one side is a petty local interest, in a great degree
imaginary.”<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> But if this “petty local interest” were
of sufficient importance to prevail for so long a time in
France, against such influences, it must be because there
was something of intrinsic strength in its character. I
allude thus minutely to this testimony, because I would
not keep anything out of the discussion calculated to
shed light, and because it seems to me that the long-continued
practice of France, in spite of such testimony,
must not be disregarded in our endeavors to arrive at a
true policy.</p>

<p>Thus far our Government has followed the teachings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
from the practice of France, rather than from its science
on this subject. It renounced, some time ago, the policy
of a single mint, acting, it may be supposed, under
other considerations of a controlling character. The
statute of March 3, 1835, entitled “An Act to establish
branches of the Mint of the United States,”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> provides
for mints at New Orleans, Charlotte, in North
Carolina, and Dahlonega, in Georgia,&mdash;the two latter
for coinage of gold only. Since then there has been
provision for mints at San Francisco, Denver, and Carson
City.</p>

<p>I have not before me the most recent statement of
the production at these different mints; but this is not
necessary for illustration. If we take the year 1851, we
find that the number of pieces, gold, silver, and copper,
produced that year, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Gold, silver and copper production" style="margin: auto; max-width: 15em;">
  <tr>
    <td>Philadelphia</td><td class="tdr">24,985,736</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>New Orleans</td><td class="tdr">3,527,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Charlotte</td><td class="tdr">105,366</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dahlonega</td><td class="tdr">83,856</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So that mints were kept up at the two latter places
merely to manufacture a very small amount of coin,
and the reason assigned was, that gold was produced
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Looking at the cost of production at these different
places, we find that at Philadelphia it was only forty-two
hundredths per cent,&mdash;at New Orleans, one and
eight hundredths per cent,&mdash;at Charlotte, three and
fifty-five hundredths per cent,&mdash;at Dahlonega, three
and thirteen hundredths per cent. But, great as was
the economy at Philadelphia, compared with that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the other mints, we find that at the Paris mint the
same production costs one half less.</p>

<p>If we look further at the mints of Charlotte and
Dahlonega, it is easy to see how every consideration
of economy was against them. With a single Munich
press in the mint at Charlotte, the whole annual coinage
there would have been accomplished in thirty-five
hours; and with a similar press at Dahlonega, the
whole annual coinage there would have been accomplished
in less than twenty-eight hours! Experience
shows that one Munich press will coin in a day of ten
hours, allowing one sixth of the time for stoppages and
accidents, thirty thousand pieces. Of course the coinage
at these two places must have been at an expense
much beyond that of Philadelphia. It would be more
economical for the Treasury to pay the cost of transporting
the gold from these places to Philadelphia.
And doubtless this would be done, if the question of
economy were alone involved.</p>

<p>I refer to these instances as illustrations of the policy
already adopted. I need not say that they do not commend
themselves to my judgment, especially when it
is considered that in all probability the coinage at these
mints, besides being expensive, was also of an inferior
quality.</p>

<p>But the vast products of gold in distant California
presented the question in a new form. Unexpectedly,
the early prodigies of Mexico and Peru were renewed.
Private persons were suddenly enriched. Gold
was turned up like clods of earth, or washed from
sands deposited by mountain torrents. Where gold so
abounded, the currency of the country was naturally in
this metal, which thus performed its double function of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
merchandise and money. Should all this treasure be
sent far away to Philadelphia for coinage? The answer
of reason, convenience, and commerce was clearly
against such enforced transportation. A mint became
a necessity. Even assuming that the coinage could be
executed with more economy and perfection at Philadelphia,
it is evident that the local interests of California
were too important to be neglected. The mint
was established, and during the last year gold has been
coined there to the amount of $17,510,960, while the
smaller amount of $3,340,931 was the sum-total of gold
coinage during the same time at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It is now proposed to create another mint in Oregon,
and the reasons for it are similar to those which prevailed
in the case of California. The region is fruitful
in gold, if not to the same extent as California, yet so
much so as to require similar facilities for coinage. It
seems that the amount received at three private assay-offices
in the city of Portland, from January 15th to
October 20th of the last year, reached $2,486,496.
Compare this sum with the paltry yield at Charlotte
or Dahlonega, where mints were established and maintained
down to the Rebellion. The mines of Peru
have been proverbial for richness; but the sum-total
of their product in 1858 was only $6,000,000. That
of Chile was $5,000,000; and that of Bolivia was only
$2,000,000,&mdash;being less than the product of Oregon for
nine months.</p>

<p>Here, again, the considerations of science, so strong in
favor of a single mint, seem to lose their applicability,
or rather they fail in presence of other considerations
not to be neglected. Sir, we cannot forget in legislation
that it is no narrow territory that comes within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
our jurisdiction, but that it is a vast region, washed by
two great oceans and separated by intervening mountains.
A rule which may be proper in a country like
France becomes inapplicable to a country so vast in
space. If all our States were huddled together on a
single seaboard, perhaps a single mint might suffice.
In such a case economy and perfection of coinage
might be exclusively consulted. But the interests of
business on the Pacific coast must not be sacrificed
even to these considerations. Spain still has mints
at Madrid and Seville, although at the latter place the
coinage is chiefly confined to copper; but in former
days, while Mexico was a Spanish province, there was
a Spanish mint there,&mdash;for the same reason, I suppose,
that a mint is now proposed in Oregon.</p>

<p>The consideration from distance alone cannot be disregarded.
Oregon is more than five thousand miles
from Philadelphia, and seven hundred miles from San
Francisco. It is impossible to legislate for such immense
spaces as you would legislate for a European
kingdom, where every part is within easy distance of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>In England a single mint transacts the business of
that commercial country. But I need not remind you
that all its immense commerce is conducted within a
small territory. In Holland, also, there is only a single
mint,&mdash;although during the days of the Republic there
was a mint in each province. Afterwards these were
abandoned, and one mint for the whole kingdom was
established at Utrecht. But here again I remind you
of the narrow space of territory served by this mint.</p>

<p>The whole question is obscured by considering gold,
when coined, as exclusively currency, whereas it is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
merchandise. In this latter character it comes under
the laws governing commerce in other articles. If we
go back to Aristotle, we find a definition difficult to
improve in our day. “It is agreed,” says this master
of thought, “to give and receive in exchange <em>a substance
which, useful in itself</em>, is easily managed in the usage of
life: as, for example, iron, silver, or such other substance
as shall have a determined dimension and weight, and
which, in order to avoid the embarrassment of continual
weighing, <em>shall be marked by a particular stamp as the
sign of its value</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> In quoting these words, Michel Chevalier,
the political economist and new-made Senator of
France, who has given much attention to this subject,
rightly says that the whole question is admirably put
and at the same time determined.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> But the same idea
has been presented by Adam Smith in his remarkable
work on the Wealth of Nations. “The qualities,” he
says, “of utility, beauty, and scarcity are the original
foundation of the high price of those metals, or of the
great quantity of other goods for which they can everywhere
be exchanged. <em>This value was antecedent to and
independent of their being employed as coin, and was the
quality which fitted them for that employment.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Therefore
it must not be forgotten that coin is something
more than money; it is merchandise also. In this
character it plays a conspicuous part in the commerce
of the world. It differs in bulk from the lumber of
Maine, but it is just as much an article of merchandise.</p>

<p>Regarding gold as merchandise, we see how clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in certain places and under certain circumstances it escapes
from the scientific laws applicable especially to
coinage. Gold is unique among articles of commerce.
Every other article allows discussion as to its quality.
Cloth or wool may be more or less fine; flour more or
less bolted, or it may be made from hard or soft wheat.
But gold is chemically a simple body, and, when once
refined, perfectly homogeneous, whether from California
or Siberia, from the sands of Transylvania or the
poorer sands of the Upper Rhine. Let it be once
brought to any arbitrary standard, as, say, nine tenths,
and there is no difference in its character. But this
degree of fineness must be established <em>in authentic
manner</em>,&mdash;otherwise transactions in this article may
be arrested at every moment. The delicate agencies
necessary for determining its value are not easily accessible.
The Government, therefore, as representative
of the community, after refining and weighing gold,
puts upon it a stamp which guaranties its weight and
fineness. Thus, the eagle, with the stamp of ten dollars,
is a piece which, according to the Act of Congress
of 18th January, 1837,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> weighs two hundred and
fifty-eight grains, with nine tenths of gold and one
tenth of alloy. The English sovereign is a stamped
piece of gold twenty-two carats fine, and of such weight
in proportion to the troy ounce that £3 17<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i>
make an ounce. The French franc is a stamped piece
of silver weighing exactly five grammes, and nine tenths
fine.</p>

<p>But in our country, and now especially in California
and on the Pacific coast, gold has become a principal
article of production and exportation, like wheat or cotton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Such is its character that it instinctively seeks <em>inspection</em>,
in order to secure a guaranty and recommendation.
Now every State has its inspectors, for instance,
of flour, pot and pearl ashes, fish, beef, and pork. In
Massachusetts there are inspectors of sole-leather, although
a hide of leather is open on all sides. But, if
gold be regarded as merchandise, there is more reason
for its inspection. As it is more portable than these
other articles, so it is also more valuable, more easily
lost, more easily stolen, and more provocative to plunder.
Therefore it is entitled to peculiar safeguards.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the case in a nutshell. California is already
a large exporter of gold as merchandise. Oregon
is now commencing a similar career. But the gold there
ought to have every advantage as merchandise which
it can derive from the inspection of the Government.
Call it protection, if you will; but I beg to submit
that an interest so important, so peculiar, and so delicate,
deserves this protection.</p>

<p>If it be said that all this may be accomplished by
an assay office, I reply, that this does only partially
what is accomplished by the mint. The gold is delivered
back in ingots stamped, so that for certain purposes
it is merchandise; but the work is only half
done. If the quantity were trivial, as at Charlotte and
Dahlonega, then an assay office would suffice; but
where the supply is so great as in California or Oregon,
it would seem as if no pains ought to be spared by
the Government to facilitate the commerce in this article,
or to meet the desires of its producers. Now it
is obvious that nothing in this respect can equal the
stamp upon the national coin. A courtier said to Philip
the Second of Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> “Your golden ducats carry your
name and your features over all the countries of Europe,
exciting envy and dread.” The time for envy and
dread has passed; but our eagles are not idle. There
is their inscription, <i>E pluribus unum</i>, an unquestionable
stamp of nationality and value, which they carry wherever
they go.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, while admitting, that, for the sake of
the coin, there should be the highest accuracy possible
in the operations of the mint, I cannot hesitate to insist,
that, regarding gold as merchandise, the mint must
be established in such localities as may be required by
the interests of commerce.</p>

<p>I do not think there would be any hesitation in this
conclusion, if the whole subject of coinage had not been
shrouded with a certain mystery, almost like the “black
art.” This appears constantly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“They cannot touch me for <em>coining</em>;</div>
<div class="verse">I am the king,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">says Shakespeare; and Pope says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“She now contracts her vast design,</div>
<div class="verse">And all her triumphs shrink into a coin.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Like other incidents of sovereignty, coinage is reserved
rightfully to the Government, and on this account is
little appreciated in its true character. People sometimes
err in not seeing that the delicate laws applicable
to this subject must not be strained to interfere with
the proper regulation of the value of gold when it has
become a principal article of commerce.</p>

<p>Objection is also made on the ground that a mint is
necessarily an expensive structure. But this is a mistake,
arising partly from the general mystification on
the subject, and partly because the Philadelphia mint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
which we have all seen, is an expensive structure. A
mint, in plain terms, is nothing but a foundry provided
with good locks and keys. If finished elaborately and
expensively, it may attract the eye, but does not become
more useful. The whole system of coinage has
been twice changed during the present generation: first,
by the change in assays of Gay-Lussac in 1830; and,
secondly, by the introduction of the Munich press
worked by steam, instead of the old hand-press with
two ponderous balls as flies. And the Munich press
itself has been much improved in France by Thonnelier.
Now a mint should not be so costly as not
to receive easily all improvements. The science of
metallurgy is still in progress of development, and it
cannot be doubted that the coming generation will witness
improvements as important as any during our day.
The eminent French authority to whom I have already
referred, Dumas, was in the habit of ridiculing the expensive
mints constructed in France. He desired that
the present mint at Paris should be surrendered to
some public office, and the business removed to an
open space in the suburbs. In his Report he has furnished
estimates showing the small expense of a mint,
according to his ideas, adequate to all the coinage of
France.</p>

<p>If you would see how the cost of a mint in our
country may swell, at least in calculations on paper, if
not in reality, I refer you to the memorial of the Board
of Trade of Philadelphia in relation to the establishment
of a branch mint at New York in 1852. But the
mint pictured here is anything but the simple foundry
which I have described, or the workshop which the
Senator from Oregon asks you to authorize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. President, I hope that I have not occupied too
much time with this statement. I am led to make it
in order to show, that, in differing from the Committee
on Finance, I have not proceeded without proper consideration.
There are topics connected with the subject
to which I do not allude, because I desire to confine
my remarks to the points in issue. There are also
details as to the cost of coinage in a well-regulated
mint, involving the question of seigniorage, and the
essential difference between the systems of England
and France, which I should be glad to present; but
I have said enough. There is, however, one practical
remark, founded on the example of Spain, which I venture
to add. It was the habit of this power to require
that the initial letter of the place of coinage should appear
on every piece, so that the coin from Madrid bore
an M, from Seville an S, and that from Mexico M.
This precaution rendered each mint responsible for its
own work. In France, also, every mint had its special
mark. The coins struck at Paris bear the letter A.
Perhaps a similar requirement in our country might
stimulate greater care in the several mints, by creating
an honorable rivalry.</p>

<p>There is one other remark which I would make before
I close. Much stress has been placed upon the
opinion of the Director of the mint at Philadelphia.
Indeed, the whole case against the proposed mint has
been allowed to rest on his letter, which begins so
whimsically. I hope that I have not spoken of him
too freely; but, since his authority is invoked, I am
led to ask if there is anything in his studies or scientific
attainments calculated to render him a court without
appeal on this question. It is obvious that his position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
for the time being subjects him to influences hostile
to new mints. He naturally seeks to amplify his
jurisdiction, and to keep the tide of gold secure so that
it shall not ebb from his marble building. Perhaps I
do not use too strong language, if I say that he is under
inducements to play the pedant for his own mint, and
to quote it against every other mint. At all events, I
think the Senate will be satisfied that on the present
occasion he ought to be overruled.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 30, 1864, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in the following bill, which was read twice, and
ordered to lie on the table and be printed.</p>

<p>This was a first effort for Civil Service Reform.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">A Bill to provide for the greater Efficiency of the Civil
Service of the United States.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress
assembled</i>, That the President be, and he hereby is, authorized
to appoint, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, a Board of Examiners, consisting
of three Commissioners, at salaries of __ dollars a
year. And the Commissioners may appoint a clerk to
the Board, with an annual compensation of two thousand
dollars. And these sums, and the necessary expenses
of the Board, including rent and the travelling
expenses of the Commissioners and clerk, shall be paid
from any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That no person
shall be appointed, after the date of this Act, to
any civil office under the United States, whether by
way of original appointment or promotion, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
recommended by a certificate of the Board: <i>Provided</i>,
That this shall not apply to offices the appointing
power to which is by the Constitution vested in the
President by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate: but applicants for such offices shall be examined
by the Board, if they present themselves, and shall
receive certificates in the same manner as other applicants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Board
shall hold examinations of applicants for civil office under
the United States at such places as they may designate,
and at times to be determined by consideration of
the needs of the service, and the number of vacancies
to be filled, after consultation with the President, courts,
or heads of departments, as the case may be, and after
public notice of the time, place, and regulations of the
proposed examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That applicants
for examination shall be citizens of the United States,
(including all persons born in the United States, and
not owing allegiance elsewhere,) between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-five, and shall furnish such testimonials
of personal character and take such oath of
allegiance as the Board shall prescribe: <i>Provided</i>, That,
if the examination is for any office the duties of which
are to be performed in any particular State, then the
applicant, in addition to the above requirements, shall
have resided in such State one year before the time of
examination, and in such case the Board shall designate
a place of examination within such State: <i>Provided,
however</i>, That the President may suspend the
operation of the preceding proviso as to any States or
parts of States where he may deem it expedient so to
do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 5.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Board
shall determine, after consultation with the President,
courts, or heads of departments, as the case may be,
upon the subjects of examination, and also whether the
examination shall be oral, written, or both, and shall
have full discretion as to the regulation of the examinations,
and may employ such learned and honorable men
as they may see fit to assist in the examinations, or to
superintend examinations in their absence, and shall report
their doings annually to Congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 6.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Board,
after the examination, shall assign the rank of the applicants,
according to the degree of merit and fitness
shown; and he who stands at the head of the list shall
have the choice of vacancies in the particular department
or branch for which he was examined, and so
on down the list to the minimum of merit fixed by
the Board, beyond which no certificate shall be given.
The Board may, if they see fit, assign the right of
seniority as a result of the first examination, or may
require a further examination, the result of which shall
determine seniority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 7.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, after the
appointment of a candidate recommended by the Board,
he shall not be removed except for good cause, and promotions
shall be according to seniority, which shall be
determined in all cases by the dates of the recommendations
of the Board and the rank therein assigned; but
it shall be allowable to make one fifth of the promotions
on account of merit irrespective of seniority.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This bill found an unexpected response from the public press. The
<i>National Intelligencer</i>, at Washington, welcomed it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The object of this bill commands our entire approval, and we hope it
may equally receive the approval of Congress. Its passage, more than any
other single decision that could be taken by Congress in the way of needed
reforms, would tend to correct abuses which threaten our whole political
system with wreck and ruin.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Evening Post</i>, of New York, was equally explicit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This bill, if passed, would do away with what has become one of the
most serious vices in our political life, the ‘Spoils system,’ as it has been appropriately
called. Congress should, as soon as possible, provide some rules
for the reformation of this universal evil. The patronage of the President
and his Cabinet officers has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished;
it has become, by the extension of the country, the increase of population
and wealth, and especially through the circumstances of the present
war, so vast as to be dangerous to the nation, if it should chance to fall into
the hands of unscrupulous and wicked men. But, besides this, it is manifestly
impossible to carry on the immense business of the Government without
extraordinary and ruinous loss and waste, under the old system of turning
out the occupants of civil offices every four years. The Government thus
virtually refuses the services of trained men, familiar with the office routine.
If we desire public affairs to be administered honestly and economically,
Congress must provide for the numerous servants of the Government regular
grades of promotion, retention of office during good behavior, and, if possible,
a small retiring pension, which might be arranged in the shape of an annuity
and life insurance combined.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>Times</i> noticed it at length, beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner has introduced a bill into the Senate, which, owing to the
general absorption of the public attention in the great events which are taking
place in the field, will probably not attract much notice; but it nevertheless
attempts to deal with a matter which is of more importance, we venture to
say, to the stability of this Government than any other one thing except the
extinction of the Rebellion. It is neither more nor less than a sweeping
measure of administrative reform, obliging all candidates for situations in
the public service to pass an examination before a board appointed for the
purpose, giving them their offices during good behavior, and with promotion
through the various grades in the order of seniority, and a retiring pension
after a certain term of service.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New Nation</i>, of New York, said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner has recently brought a bill in the Senate to regulate the
conditions of admission to public offices of the highest importance to the
country. This bill is based upon the most equitable, the most sincerely republican,
and the most progressive principles as yet adopted in any country.
We have not sufficient space to review this project at present. At the first
glance we find it deficient only in one respect, namely, in carrying respect
for seniority to too great an extent. If this bill is passed, the era of inefficiency
and favoritism, hitherto prevailing, will be at an end.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New Bedford <i>Mercury</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s bill will cure the evils of which every sensible man now
complains, and avert the terrible dangers which menace us. It contemplates
a return to the practice of the better days of the republic, and making that
practice the rule. ‘Is he capable? Is he honest?’ were the inquiries propounded
by Jefferson, when a candidate for office was named.”</p>

</div>

<p>The New York <i>World</i> devoted a leading article to the bill, which
it criticized.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We had supposed, that, in the opinion of Mr. Sumner, the disposition to
be made of black men came nearest, in legislative importance, to the crushing
out of the Rebels.… Mr. Sumner’s bill does not touch the evil in our
clerical system. The difficulty is not in want of examination, classification,
promotion, or pension, but springs, in the first place, out of the manner in
which the President, through the heads of departments, exercises the appointing
power, and, in the next place, out of the conduct of the clerks themselves,
when in office. An examining board cannot change the general character
of the men the President, directly or indirectly, sends before it.”</p>

</div>

<p>These notices show the interest excited by this effort. In the various
labors which occupied Mr. Sumner he was not able to give it the attention
it required. Meanwhile the cause found an able advocate elsewhere.</p>

<p>The next step was by Hon. Thomas A. Jenckes, of Rhode Island,
who introduced into the House of Representatives, December 20, 1865,
a bill “To regulate the Civil Service of the United States,” which was
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. Subsequently a special
committee was appointed on the Civil Service of the United States, with
Mr. Jenckes as Chairman, and June 13, 1866, he reported his bill to the
House. Then again, at the next session, he reported another bill, “To
regulate the Civil Service of the United States, and promote the efficiency
thereof,” which he sustained by a forcible and elaborate speech;
but the bill was laid on the table,&mdash;Yeas 72, Nays 66. Other efforts
followed at subsequent sessions, but without success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, in the Senate, on motion of Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois,
March 3, 1871, the following section was attached to the General Appropriation
Bill, then pending:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized
to prescribe such rules and regulations for the admission of persons into the
Civil Service of the United States as will best promote the efficiency thereof,
and ascertain the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character,
knowledge, and ability, for the branch of service into which he seeks to
enter; and for this purpose the President is authorized to employ suitable
persons to conduct said inquiries, to prescribe their duties, and to establish
regulations for the conduct of persons who may receive appointments in the
Civil Service.”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Under this provision President Grant appointed the following Commissioners:
George William Curtis, of New York; Alexander G. Cattell,
of New Jersey; Joseph Medill, of Illinois; and Dawson A. Walker,
E. B. Elliott, Joseph H. Blackfan, and David C. Cox, of the District
of Columbia: who, after careful consideration during the summer and
autumn, submitted a report December 18, 1871, with a schedule of
rules and regulations, all of which was promptly communicated to Congress
by the President.</p>

<p>February 13th, Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to bring in a bill to amend section five of an Act
entitled “An Act to continue, alter, and amend the charter of the city
of Washington,” approved May 17, 1848, and further to preserve the
purity of elections and guard against the abuse of the elective franchise,
by a registration of electors for the city of Washington, in the District

the Committee on the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>March 8th, Mr. Dixon, from the Committee, reported the bill without
amendment.</p>

<p>March 17th, the bill was taken up and amended in unimportant particulars.</p>

<p>May 6th, it was again taken up, when, after an amendment moved
by Mr. Dixon, Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, moved to amend the bill
in the first section by inserting the word “white” before the word
“male,” so as to confine the right of voting in Washington to white
male citizens. Mr. Sumner said at once, “I hope not.” Mr. Cowan
then spoke in favor of his amendment.</p>

<p>May 12th, Mr. Cowan remarked that the bill “would have the effect,
in some cases, of admitting negroes to the right of suffrage, which, I may
say, is obnoxious to the vast bulk of the people of the Border States.”
Mr. Harlan would vote for Mr. Cowan’s amendment, “first, because it
is manifest to the Senate that the bill, without that provision in it,
cannot now become a law.” Mr. Willey, of West Virginia, spoke elaborately
against colored suffrage, winding up with this interrogatory:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
“Shall we, without any petitions from the people of this District,
without anything before the Senate to indicate that this bill, in any of
its parts, is required by the people of this District, undertake to say, of
our own volition, that we will impose upon them a provision which is
odious to them, and will, in my estimation, be disastrous in its results,
not only here, but in its influence on popular opinion everywhere in
this nation?”</p>

It dies hard in the Senate Chamber. We have been
compelled during this session to hear various defences
of Slavery, sometimes in its most offensive forms. Slave-hunting
has been openly vindicated. And now, to-day,
the exclusion of colored persons from the electoral franchise,
simply on account of color, is openly vindicated,
and the Senator from West Virginia, newly introduced
into this Chamber from a State born of Freedom, rises
here to uphold Slavery in one of its meanest products.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Willey.</span> Mr. President, I cannot pass that assertion
without giving it an unequivocal, categorical denial. I have
not vindicated Slavery in any of its aspects. I said to the
Senator, what perhaps he did not hear before, that, when he
has liberated by the sweat of his brow as many slaves as I
have, he can get up and make such a remark in regard to
me.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I said, Sir, that the Senator vindicated
Slavery in one of its meanest products. I repeat what I
said. The Senator has spoken, I do not know how long
by the clock, to vindicate an odious prejudice bequeathed
by Slavery, having its origin in Slavery, and in nothing
else. Had Slavery never existed among us, there would
have been no such prejudice as that of which the Senator
makes himself the representative. Far better would
it be for that Senator, who comes into this Chamber as
the representative of a new-born free State, had he surrendered
generously to the sentiment in which West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Virginia had its birth. But, instead, he comes forward
and labors with unwonted earnestness to perpetuate
at the national capital an odious feature derived
from Slavery. The Senator says he has not vindicated
Slavery. If he has not used the word, he has vindicated
the thing, in one of its most odious features. He
seeks to blast a whole race merely on account of color.
Would he ever have proposed such injustice, but for
the prejudices nursed by Slavery? Had not Slavery
existed, would any such idea have found place in a
Senator naturally so generous and humane? No, Sir,&mdash;he
spoke with the voice of Slavery, which he cannot
yet forget. He spoke under the unhappy and disturbing
influences which Slavery has left in his mind.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I am against Slavery, wherever it shows
itself, whatever form it takes. I am against Slavery,
when compelled to meet it directly; and I am against
Slavery in all its products and its offspring. I am
against Slavery, when encountering the beast outright,
or only its tail. The prejudices of which the Senator
makes himself the representative to-day, permit me to
say, are nothing but the tail of Slavery. Unhappily,
while we have succeeded in abolishing Slavery in this
District, we have not yet abolished the tail; and the
tail has representatives in the Senate Chamber, as the
beast once had.</p>

<p>We have been reminded that we are engaged in a
fearful conflict. The Senator has reminded us of it.
Senators nearer to me have reminded us of it. This
is too true; and now, as that conflict lowers, I invoke
the spirit of our fathers. They went forth to battle
with the Declaration of Independence on their lips, solemnly
declaring that all men are born equal, entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They introduced
no discrimination of color into that sacred
text, nor into the contemporary Articles of Confederation,
nor into the Constitution of the United States,
which was the work of their hands. I am content to
be guided by their example. As they went forth to
meet the enemy, they placed themselves under the protection
of the God of Justice. Let us imitate them.</p>

<p>I had not intended to say a word on this occasion;
but I could not listen to the remarks of the Senator, so
harsh and unfeeling toward a whole race, belonging to
the human family, like himself, without interposing a
solemn protest.</p>

<p>Since this debate began, I have sent to the Law Library
for a volume containing the authoritative words
of a distinguished Southern jurist, a slaveholder, with
regard to the electoral franchise. It has been a question,
in what States, at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution, colored persons enjoyed this franchise. I
say nothing now about the more northern States; but
there is a State, sometimes referred to, with regard to
which there is peculiar evidence: I mean North Carolina.
The enjoyment of the electoral franchise by colored
persons in that State for a long time after the Constitution
is not a matter of doubt. Her most eminent
magistrate, the late Mr. Justice Gaston, accomplished
as a jurist and as a man, whom I remember well in
most agreeable personal intercourse, laid down the law
of his State in emphatic words. Pronouncing the opinion
of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in the case
of <i>The State</i> v. <i>Manuel</i>, in 1838, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slaves manumitted here become freemen, and therefore,
if born within North Carolina, are citizens of North Carolina;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>and all free persons born within the State are born citizens
of the State.… The Constitution extended the elective
franchise to every freeman who had arrived at the age of
twenty-one and paid a public tax; <em>and it is a matter of
universal notoriety, that, under it, free persons, without regard
to color, claimed and exercised the franchise, until it
was taken from free men of color a few years since by our
amended Constitution</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is still another case, that of <i>The State</i> v.
<i>Newsom</i>, which was decided in 1844, where the Supreme
Court of North Carolina, after citing the opinion
of Judge Gaston from which I have just read, proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That case underwent a very laborious investigation, both
by the bar and the bench.… The case was brought here
by appeal, and was felt to be one of great importance in
principle. It was considered with an anxiety and care worthy
of the principle involved, and which gave it a controlling
influence and authority on all questions of a similar
character.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Therefore not hastily or carelessly did the Supreme
Court of North Carolina declare colored persons to be
voters under the State Constitution.</p>

<p>Such was the constitutional law of North Carolina,
fashioned by our fathers under the influence of the
Declaration of Independence. Sir, I am content with
that law. I do not think the Senator from Pennsylvania
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>], though he represents a Northern
State, can mend that law from a Slave State. Nor do
I think that any of us on this floor can feel humbled,
if our judgment is postponed to that of Judge Gaston
of North Carolina, who did not hesitate to declare positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the constitutional law of human rights, by virtue
of which colored persons are citizens. And if they
are citizens, how can you deny them the electoral franchise?</p>

<p>I am content to leave the question here, adding, that,
as I understand it, I shall deem it my duty to vote
against all propositions creating any discrimination of
color. At this moment of revolution, when our country
needs the blessing of Almighty God and the strong
arms of all her children, this is not the time for us solemnly
to enact injustice. In duty to our country, and
in duty to God, I plead against any such thing. We
must be against Slavery in its original shape, and in all
its brood of prejudice and error.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This bill was never considered again; but the question of colored
suffrage in Washington reappeared.</p>

<p>May 24th, Mr. Wade, from the Committee on the District of Columbia,
reported a joint resolution to amend the charter of the city of
Washington, which was read twice and considered as in Committee of
the Whole. In reporting it, he said: “It relates to the registration
of voters; and if it is to be passed at all, it ought to be passed immediately.
I believe there is no objection to it. It alters none of the
present qualifications of voters, but improves the present law as to
registration, which is very defective.”</p>

<p>May 26th, the consideration of the joint resolution was resumed, when
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Examining this joint resolution, I find that it is entitled
“A Resolution to amend the charter of the city
of Washington.” In that aspect it is important. Looking
into it, I find the provision,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in case any person shall offer and claim the right
to vote at any election held in the city of Washington, whose
name is not registered, his name shall be registered by the
Commissioners of Election upon the terms and conditions
following.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the language is very broad.
It is applicable to any person who shall offer and claim
the right to vote at any election; and his name shall be
registered upon certain specified conditions. The first
condition is, that he shall take a certain oath; and if
unable to understand the English language, it is further
provided that the oath shall be interpreted to him:
so that this clause actually contemplates that certain
persons shall be registered who do not speak the English
language. It then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If in his answers on oath he shall state positively that
he has resided in the city one year next preceding the day
of said election, designating particularly the place of his residence,
and that he possesses the other qualifications of an
elector, and if, furthermore, some qualified elector of the city,
not a candidate for any office at that election, shall take an
oath before said Commissioners, which any one of them may
administer, that he is well acquainted with such applicant,
that he is, in fact, a resident in the city, and has been one
year next previous to such election, and that he (qualified
elector) has good reason to believe, and does believe, that all
the statements of such applicant are true, the Commissioners
shall cause his name to be registered by their clerk, and
shall then receive the vote of said applicant.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now it is at once perceived from these words, that
they are directly applicable, in the first place, to any
person who shall offer and claim the right to vote at
an election; but, after taking the oath, he is to show
residence for a certain term in the city, and also that
“he possesses the other qualifications of an elector.”
What are “the other qualifications of an elector”? I
presume, if we go back to the original charter, we shall
find it is that qualification which, as I said the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
day, is the tail of Slavery,&mdash;that discrimination of color
left to us, unhappily, by the former presence of Slavery
in the national capital. I know not if the Committee
propose to keep alive that ancient and odious
discrimination; but it seems to me, that, if the language
of this joint resolution be interpreted according
to its natural signification, and certainly as such language
is apt to be interpreted here in Washington, it
must operate to the exclusion of persons not of the
favored color. I know my friend from Ohio does not
contemplate such exclusion; but a joint resolution to
amend the charter of the city of Washington ought to
be made clear, and also in that respect unobjectionable;
it ought not to be the means of continuing and of extending
that odious discrimination. I therefore propose
to amend it by adding these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That there shall be no exclusion of any person
from the register on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wade was in favor of colored suffrage; but the Committee, in
reporting this measure, did “not contemplate going into the question
of the right of suffrage, or extending that right beyond those who are
at present authorized to exercise it. It does not widen the suffrage;
it does not narrow it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner began a reply to Mr. Wade.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The argument of my friend from
Ohio was, that the measure now before the Senate is
temporary in its character. That is inconsistent with
the title of the joint resolution, which is as follows.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> Let me explain. I say temporary, because
we all know that there is a bill fixing the right of voting,
that, I suppose, is intended as a permanent law. This is
temporary in that view. That is all I meant.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That certainly will not justify my
friend in his argument, for on the face of it this is
permanent. It is as permanent as anything else in
the existing charter. Its title is, “A Resolution to
amend the charter of the city of Washington.” When
this is done, what assurance has my friend that anything
else will be done? There is a bill on our tables.
How many other bills are there on other matters which
we may not reach during this session, or, if we reach,
on which we cannot expect harmonious votes in the
two Houses!</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner was interrupted by the Tax Bill, which was the
order of the day.</p>

<p>May 27th, Mr. Sumner resumed.</p>

</div>

<p>I was interrupted yesterday by other business, called
up while I was replying to my friend from Ohio [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wade</span>]. I did not propose any extended reply.</p>

<p>It is with pain that I differ from friends. But with
me there is no choice. Here is a measure which opens
the whole question of suffrage in the national capital,
and assumes the form of amendment to the charter of
the city of Washington. It provides that certain persons
shall be registered, including even those who cannot
speak English; but in positive terms <em>it continues
and keeps alive the old rule founded on color</em>. Now, Sir,
I cannot sanction any such rule directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>But it is said, that, in pressing my amendment, the
original proposition may be lost. This I shall regret
much; for I desire its passage sincerely. But I can see
no reason why a discrimination of color should be made
in the bill, or in our proceedings. If white persons are
kept out of their rights, so are colored persons; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
would ask my friend from Ohio, Which has been kept
out the longest? I am for the rights of both, to the
end that we may have at last in the national capital
<em>Equality before the law</em>.</p>

<p>We are shocked daily by the report of outrages upon
colored persons. In Tennessee a colored woman has
been murdered under the lash. Near Fortress Monroe
another colored woman has been cruelly treated under
the lash. This must be stopped. But I know no way
so effective as to set an example of justice and humanity.
If we sanction slave-hunting, if we disregard the
rights of colored persons, if we treat them as inferior in
condition, unhappily, Sir, there are others who will follow
our example, and add a vindictive cruelty.</p>

<p>Therefore, insisting upon the rights of colored persons
here, I insist upon their rights everywhere. Nor do I
see how I can abandon their rights here without abandoning
them everywhere. We are Senators of the
United States, bound to consider the whole country in
all its extent, and to do nothing here which shall do
mischief elsewhere; nor can we yield to any local pressure,
or any imagined local interests, and thus forget the
cause of justice.</p>

<p>It is vain to say that this measure is temporary; for,
in plain terms, it undertakes to amend the charter of
Washington. It is vain to say, also, that there is another
bill now on your calendar regulating this whole
question. Who can say that this bill will become a
law? Ay, Sir, who can say, that, in the hurried hours
of these closing days of a weary session, the bill will
even be considered again? And yet on these grounds
we are asked to abandon the present assertion of the
rights of colored persons. If the bill conferring these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
rights can pass, so also can the present measure. If
it be practical to assert these rights on one bill, it is
equally practical to assert them on another, where such
assertion is germane. It only remains that Senators
should stand firm.</p>

<p>For myself, I will not sanction injustice; nor will I
miss any opportunity of asserting the rights of an oppressed
race. I may be alone; but, to the extent of my
powers, I mean to be right.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Morrill appealed to Mr. Sumner to withdraw his opposition,
saying: “Now, as a question of practical statesmanship, I submit to
my honorable friend whether it is not the part of wisdom to say we
will do this now and we will consider the other question when it comes
up.” Mr. Harlan moved to amend by adding, “who have borne arms
in the military service of the United States, and have been honorably
discharged therefrom.” This amendment, limiting Mr. Sumner’s proposition,
was agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 12.</p>

<p>May 28th, Mr. Sumner spoke again, and adduced the details of the
recent outrage in Tennessee, saying, in conclusion:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>We all feel, Sir, the brutality of this act. It was
done by a white man on the person of a colored woman.
Would he have been the author of such a brutality, had
the woman been white? No; because she was black,
he thus insulted human nature, and performed an act
never to be read without a blush that he is a member of
the human family. And how are we to discountenance
such acts? Is it by keeping alive this odious discrimination
of color, by imparting to it the sanction of law,
by investing it with the authority of this Chamber? I
appeal to you, Senators, as men of humanity, do not
continue a discrimination, which, proceeding from this
Chamber, must exercise a far-reaching influence. It is
not simply the question of a few voters more or less
in the District, but it is a question of human rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
everywhere throughout this land, involving the national
character and its good name forevermore.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Again, in reply to Mr. Reverdy Johnson, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>But the Senator thinks that I am not logical, because
I quote an outrage in Tennessee having its origin
in the prejudice of color, and insist that here in
this Chamber we shall not found legislation on a prejudice
of color. Sir, I submit the question to the judgment
of the Senate: Am I illogical, or is the Senator
so? I insist, Sir, that you cannot sanction injustice
here, especially you cannot sanction a prejudice founded
on color, without quickening that prejudice, and sustaining
it, wherever it now unhappily exists throughout
our whole country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>At the next stage of the joint resolution, the question recurred on
concurring with the amendment in Committee of the Whole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That there shall be no exclusion of any persons from the
register, on account of color, who have borne arms in the military service
of the United States, and have been honorably discharged therefrom.”</p>

</div>

<p>And it was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 18, Nays 20. The joint resolution
was then passed.</p>

<p>And so this second battle for colored suffrage was lost.</p>

in favor of his proposition. It is not now, however,

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On all printed books, magazines, pamphlets, reviews, and
all other similar printed publications, except newspapers, a
duty of five per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>I make one remark on this tax. We do not tax wheat
or corn, because they are the staff of life. In my judgment,
a tax on books is less defensible than a tax on
wheat or on corn. I believe books are the staff of life;
and I believe that our country would do itself honor, if
at this moment, when imposing a heavy tax upon all
things, it deliberately exempted books. The tax proposed
is applicable to all books,&mdash;books for family
reading, for the library, and also for the school. All
that we can get from the tax will be very small indeed.
It will not add sensibly to the Treasury, but it will impose
a burden upon knowledge. I hope, therefore, that
the Senate will strike the words out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion was rejected.</p>

<p>At the next stage of the bill Mr. Sumner renewed his motion to strike
out the tax on books, and then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I am sorry to occupy the attention
of the Senate, even for a moment, especially at this late
stage of a protracted debate. But I feel that the question
which I have presented is not adequately appreciated.
I venture to say, that, in point of principle, few
questions of equal importance have arisen on this bill.</p>

<p>The tax on books is peculiar, and, so far as I know,
without precedent in other countries. In England paper
has been taxed, but books not; here paper is to be taxed,
and books too. For instance, there is to be a tax of three
per cent on paper, and then five per cent additional on
books, making a sum-total of eight per cent on books.</p>

<p>The tax of three per cent on paper seems contrary to
sound policy. But the additional tax of five per cent on
books is more indefensible still. I have already likened
it to a tax on wheat or flour or bread, which you do not
think of imposing. More than either of these is a book
“the staff of life.” It may be likened also to a tax on
the light of day, like the English window-tax, which you
do not think of imposing. Better shut out the light of
day than the light of books.</p>

<p>The book in some cases may be a luxury, but in most
cases it is a necessary, while always the handmaid of
civilization. It is for all ages and all conditions,&mdash;for
young and old, for rich and poor, for the family circle
as well as the library,&mdash;but it is especially for the
school. In all these places you will enter and demand
eight per cent on every book. Every book, if
it had a voice, would repel the demand.</p>

<p>Why not be instructed by the example of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
when taxing everything taxable? Read the extensive
list of articles taxed at the period of most searching and
wide-spread taxation, and you do not find books. Read
that marvellous enumeration made by the genius of
Sydney Smith, and you do not find books.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Taxes upon every article which enters into the mouth,
or covers the back, or is placed under the foot; taxes upon
everything which it is pleasant to see, hear, feel, smell, or
taste; taxes upon warmth, light, and locomotion; taxes on
everything on earth and the waters under the earth, on
everything that comes from abroad or is grown at home;
taxes on the raw material; taxes on every fresh value that
is added to it by the industry of man; taxes on the sauce
which pampers man’s appetite, and the drug that restores him
to health,&mdash;on the ermine which decorates the judge, and
the rope which hangs the criminal,&mdash;on the poor man’s salt,
and the rich man’s spice,&mdash;on the brass nails of the coffin,
and the ribbons of the bride,&mdash;at bed or board, couchant or
levant,&mdash;we must pay. The school-boy whips his taxed top;
the beardless youth manages his taxed horse with a taxed
bridle on a taxed road; and the dying Englishman, pouring
his medicine which has paid seven per cent into a spoon that
has paid fifteen per cent, flings himself back upon his chintz
bed which has paid twenty-two per cent, and expires in the
arms of an apothecary who has paid a license of a hundred
pounds for the privilege of putting him to death. His whole
property is then immediately taxed from two to ten per cent.
Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for burying
him in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity
on taxed marble; and he is then gathered to his fathers,
to be taxed no more.”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A passage so exquisite in wit and language is seasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
here, especially when considering what shall
be taxed; but I ask you to bear in mind that the
English tax-gatherer never laid his hand on a book.
Everything else he might touch,&mdash;a book never.</p>

<p>And yet in our country it is proposed to tax books.
This is the land of public schools, where you boast that
education, like justice, is free to all at the common
cost. But a tax on books is in direct conflict with this
beautiful principle. Every argument for free schools
pleads also for free books,&mdash;at least for freedom from
taxation. It will be a curious inconsistency to rear
the school-house, often costly, where every child is welcomed
without charge, and then compel him to pay a
tax of eight per cent on every book he carries in his
satchel.</p>

<p>There is one term which fitly characterizes this tax.
It is a term adopted abroad, but more justly applicable
to a tax on books than to any other tax: I mean <em>a tax
on knowledge</em>. Such is the tax now proposed. And this
tax, which cannot be named without awakening just
condemnation, you are asked to make an American institution.
After long struggle in England, the various
<em>taxes on knowledge</em> are abandoned. I hope that our
country, representative and defender of liberal ideas,
will not commence a system which modern civilization
has disowned.</p>

<p>I ask for the yeas and nays.</p>

A BRIDGE FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on Bills and Conference Reports
creating a Bureau of Freedmen, June 8, 14, 15, 1864, and
February 13, 21, 22, 1865.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 1, 1864, after debate on different days in February, the
House of Representatives adopted a bill to establish a Bureau of Freedmen’s
Affairs.</p>

<p>March 2d, in the Senate, this bill was referred to the Committee on
Slavery and Freedmen, of which Mr. Sumner was Chairman.</p>

<p>May 25th, Mr. Sumner reported the bill to the Senate with a substitute.
The intermediate period was occupied by the Committee in a
careful and laborious consideration of the whole subject, involving the
question of power proper for the Bureau, whether it should be placed
in the War Department or in the Treasury Department, which already
had the care of abandoned lands. No less than nine different projects
were laid before the Committee, some by eminent citizens interested in
the freedmen, among whom were Hon. Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana,
Hon. John Jay, of New York, and Edward L. Pierce, of Massachusetts.
The House bill was not satisfactory. Mr. Owen said, in a letter
dated March 8th, “In my judgment the bill of the House will not
work.”</p>

<p>The bill reported by Mr. Sumner was drafted by him, and adopted
by the Committee. It was in ten sections, and began with these words:
“That an office is hereby created in the Treasury Department, to be
called the Bureau of Freedmen, meaning thereby such persons as have
become free since the beginning of the present war.”</p>

<p>June 8th, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, when Mr. Sumner
explained and vindicated it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senate only a short time
ago was engaged for a week considering how to
open an iron way from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It
is now to consider how to open a way from Slavery to
Freedom.</p>

<p>I regret much that only thus tardily we are able to
take up the bill for a Bureau of Freedmen. But I trust
that nothing will interfere with its consideration. In
what I have to say, I shall confine myself to a simple
statement. If I differ from others, I beg to be understood
it is in no spirit of controversy and with no pride
of opinion. Nothing of the kind can enter justly into
any such discussion.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the Senate to set forth the importance
of this measure. All must confess it at a glance.
It is clearly a charity and a duty.</p>

<p>By virtue of existing Acts of Congress, and also under
the Proclamation of the President, large numbers
of slaves have suddenly become free. These may be
counted by the hundred thousand. In the progress of
victory they will be counted by the million.</p>

<p>As they derive their freedom from the United States,
under legislative or executive acts, the National Government
cannot be excused from making such provisions
as may be required for their immediate protection
and welfare during the present <em>transition period</em>. The
freedom conferred must be rendered useful, or at least
saved from being a burden. Reports, official and unofficial,
show the necessity of action. In some places
it is a question of life and death.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to quote at length from these reports,
while all testify alike, whether from Louisiana, South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Carolina, Fortress Monroe, Vicksburg, Tennessee, or Arkansas.
I know not where the call is most urgent. It
is urgent everywhere; and in some places it is the voice
of distress.</p>

<p>Wherever our arms have prevailed, the old social system
has been destroyed. Masters have fled, and slaves
have assumed a new character. Released from former
obligations, and often adrift in the world, they naturally
look to the prevailing power. Here, for instance, is testimony
which I take from an excellent report in the department
of Tennessee, under date of April 29, 1863:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Negroes, in accordance with the Acts of Congress, free
on coming within our lines, circulated much like water; the
task was to care for and render useful.</p>

<p>“They rolled like eddies around military posts; many of
the men employed in accordance with Order No. 72, district
West Tennessee; women and children largely doing nothing
but eating and idling, the dupes of vice and crime, the unsuspecting
sources of disease.”</p>

</div>

<p>From this statement Senators may form an idea of
the numbers seeking assistance.</p>

<p>The question is often asked as to the disposition of
those persons to labor. Here, also, the testimony is
explicit. I have in my hand the answers from different
stations on this point.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Question.</span> ‘What of their disposition to labor?’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Answer.</span> <i>Corinth.</i> ‘So far as I have tested it, better than
I expected; willing to work for money, except in waiting on
the sick. One hundred and fifty hands gathered five hundred
acres of cotton in less than three weeks, much of which
time was bad weather. The owner admitted that it was
done more quickly than it could have been done with slaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>When detailed for service, they generally remained till honorably
discharged, even when badly treated. I am well satisfied,
from careful calculations, that the contrabands of this
camp and district have netted the Government, over and
above all their expenses, including rations, tents, &amp;c., at least
$3,000 per month, independent of what the women do, and
all the property brought through our lines from the Rebels.’</p>

<p>“<i>Cairo.</i> ‘Willing to labor, when they can have proper
motives.’</p>

<p>“<i>Grand Junction.</i> ‘Have manifested considerable disposition
to escape labor, having had no sufficient motives to
work.’</p>

<p>“<i>Holly Springs and Memphis.</i> ‘With few exceptions,
generally willing, even without pay. Paid regularly, they
are much more prompt.’</p>

<p>“<i>Memphis.</i> ‘Among men better than among women.
Hold out to them the inducements, benefit to themselves
and friends, essential to the industry of any race, and they
would at once be diligent and industrious.’</p>

<p>“<i>Bolivar.</i> ‘Generally good; would be improved by the
idea of pay.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Here, also, is a glimpse at Newbern, North Carolina,
under date of February 26, 1864:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Immediately on my return here, on the 12th of October,
I instituted measures for placing the different abandoned
plantations within our lines in this State under proper management
and cultivation. As soon as it became known, that,
as supervising Treasury agent, I had charge of this property,
I was visited by hundreds (and I might correctly say thousands)
of contrabands, along with numerous white persons,
desiring to obtain privileges to work upon the same.”</p>

</div>

<p>And here is the testimony of General Banks, in Louisiana:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherever in the department they have been well treated
and reasonably compensated, they have invariably rendered
faithful service to their employers. From many persons
who manage plantations I have received the information
that there is no difficulty whatever in keeping them at
work, if the conditions to which I have referred are complied
with.”</p>

</div>

<p>I do not quote further, for it would simply take time.
But I cannot forbear adding that the report from the
Commissioners on Freedmen, appointed by the Secretary
of War, accumulates ample testimony on this
head, all showing that the freedmen are anxious to find
employment. Your Treasury testifies to their productive
power, for it contains at this moment more than
a million dollars which have come from the sweat of
freedmen.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that the freedmen are not idlers.
They desire work. But, in their helpless condition, they
have not the ability to obtain it without assistance.
They are alone, friendless, and uninformed. The curse
of Slavery is still upon them. Somebody must take
them by the hand,&mdash;not to support them, but simply
to help them obtain the work which will support them.
Thus far private societies in different parts of the country,
at the East and the West, especially at all the principal
centres, have done much toward this charity. But
private societies are inadequate to the duties required.
The intervention of the National Government is necessary.
Without such intervention, many of those poor
people, freed by our acts in the exercise of a military
necessity, will be left to perish.</p>

<p>The service required is too vast and complex for unorganized
individuals. It must proceed from the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Government. This alone can supply the adequate
machinery, and extend the proper network of
assistance, with the proper unity of operation. The
National Government must interfere in the case, precisely
as in building the Pacific Railroad. Private charity
in our country is active and generous; but it is
powerless to cope with the evils arising from a wicked
institution; nor can it provide a remedy, where society
itself is overthrown.</p>

<p>There are few who will not admit that something
must be done by the Government. Cold must be the
heart that could turn away from this call. But whatever
is done must be through some designated agency;
and this brings me to another aspect of the question.</p>

<p>The President in his Proclamation of Emancipation
has used the following language: “I recommend to
them,”&mdash;that is, to the freedmen,&mdash;“that in all cases,
when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.”
Such is the recommendation from that supreme
authority which decreed Emancipation. They are to labor,
and for reasonable wages. But the President does
not undertake to say how this opportunity shall be
obtained,&mdash;how the laborer shall be brought in connection
with the land, how his rights shall be protected,
and how his new-found liberty shall be made a blessing.
It was enough, perhaps, on the occasion of the Proclamation,
that the suggestion should be made. Faithful
labor and reasonable wages: let these be secured, and
everything else will follow. But how shall they be
secured?</p>

<p>Different subjects, as they become important, are
committed to special bureaus. I need only refer to
Patents, Agriculture, Public Lands, Pensions, and Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Affairs,&mdash;each under the charge of a separate
Commissioner. Clearly, the time has come for a Bureau
of Freedmen. In speaking of this agency, I mean
a bureau which will be confined in operation to the
affairs of freedmen, and not travel beyond this increasing
class to embrace others, although of African descent.
Our present necessity is to help those made free
by the present war; and the term “freedmen” describes
sufficiently those who have once been slaves. It is this
class we propose to help during the <em>transition period</em>
from Slavery to Freedom. Call it charity or duty, it
is sacred as humanity.</p>

<p>And here a practical question arises with regard to
the department in which this bureau should be placed.
There are reasons for placing it in the War Department,
at least during the war. There are other reasons for
placing it in the Department of the Interior, which has
charge of Indian Affairs, Pensions, and Patents. But,
whatever the reasons on general grounds for placing it
in one of these two departments, there are other reasons,
of special importance at this moment, which point
to the Treasury Department. Indeed, after careful consideration,
the Committee were satisfied that it was so
clearly associated with other interests already intrusted
to this department, that it could not be advantageously
administered elsewhere. Although beginning
this inquiry with a conviction in favor of the War
Department, I could not resist the conclusion of the
Committee.</p>

<p>Look, for one moment, at the class of duties already
imposed upon the Treasury Department in connection
with the very homes of these freedmen.</p>

<p>Congress has, by special Acts, conferred upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Secretary of the Treasury extraordinary powers with
regard to trade in the Rebel States. There is, first,
the Act of July 13, 1861, entitled “An Act further to
provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for
other purposes,” which declares that commercial intercourse
with any State or part of a State in rebellion,
when licensed by the President, “shall be conducted
and carried on <em>only in pursuance</em> of rules and regulations
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.”
And it is further provided, that “the Secretary of the
Treasury may appoint such officers, at places where officers
of the customs are not now authorized by law, as
may be needed to carry into effect such licenses, rules,
and regulations.”<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>There is another Act of Congress, approved May 20,
1862, supplementary to that just named, which confers
additional powers upon the Secretary of the Treasury
with reference to trade with “any place in the
possession or under the control of insurgents against
the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>There is also the Act of June 7, 1862, entitled “An
Act for the collection of direct taxes in insurrectionary
districts within the United States, and for other
purposes.” In this Act it is provided, (section nine,)
that, where the Board of Commissioners shall be satisfied
that the owners of lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> “have left the same
to join the Rebel forces, or otherwise to engage in
and abet this Rebellion, and the same shall have been
struck off to the United States at public sale, the
said Commissioners shall, in the name of the United
States, enter upon and take possession of the same,
and may lease the same, together or in parcels, to
any person or persons who are citizens of the United
States”; and (section ten) the Commissioners
“shall from time to time make such temporary rules
and regulations and insert such clauses in said leases
as shall be just and proper to secure proper and reasonable
employment and support, at wages or upon
shares of the crop, of such persons and families as
may be residing upon the said parcels or lots of land,
which said rules and regulations are declared to be
subject to the approval of the President.”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The execution
of this Act is lodged in the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Then comes the Act of Congress, approved March
12, 1863, entitled “An Act to provide for the collection
of abandoned property and for the prevention of
frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United
States,” under which the Secretary of the Treasury
is authorized “to appoint a special agent or agents
to receive and collect all abandoned or captured property
in any State or Territory or any portion of any
State or Territory of the United States, designated as
in insurrection against the lawful Government of the
United States.” The Act proceeds with details on the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Such are powers conferred by Congress upon the
Treasury Department concerning trade and abandoned
property in the Rebel States. These were followed
by a general order from the War Department, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">General Orders</span>, No. 331.</p>

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">War Department, Adjutant-General’s Office</span>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, October 9, 1863.</p>

<p class="noindent">“The President orders:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. All houses, tenements, lands, and plantations, except
such as may be required for military purposes, which have
been or may be deserted and abandoned by insurgents within

to be in insurrection, will hereafter be under the supervision

over to the proper supervising special agent such houses,

uses, as may be in their possession or under their control;
and all officers of the army of the United States will at all
times render to the agents appointed by the Secretary of the
Treasury all such aid as may be necessary to enable them to
obtain possession of such houses, tenements, lands, and plantations,
and to maintain their authority over the same.</p>

<p>“By order of the Secretary of War.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">E. D. Townsend</span>,<br />
“<i>Assistant Adjutant-General</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>By this order, the Treasury Department is substituted
for the War Department in jurisdiction over “houses,
tenements, lands, and plantations deserted and abandoned
by insurgents within the lines of military occupation.”
This is broad, but it is positive.</p>

<p>In pursuance of these Acts of Congress, and of this
order of the War Department, the Secretary of the
Treasury has proceeded to appoint special agents and to
establish a code of regulations. I have in my hands a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
small volume, entitled “Commercial Intercourse with
and in States declared in Insurrection, and the Collection
of Abandoned and Captured Property,”<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> containing
the statutes and also the departmental regulations on
the subject. It appears that there is already an organization
under the Secretary of the Treasury, and also a
system, each of reasonable completeness, to carry out
these purposes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In determining where the Bureau of Freedmen should
be placed, it becomes important to consider the interests
it is proposed to guard; and this brings me to another
aspect of the question.</p>

<p>Looking at the freedmen whose welfare is in question,
we find that their labor may be classified under
two different heads: first, <em>military</em>; and, secondly, <em>predial</em>,
or relating to farms. There are still other laborers,
including especially mechanics; but these are chiefly
in the towns. The large mass are included in the two
classes I have named. It is, therefore, these two classes
that are to be particularly considered.</p>

<p>1. The first class is already provided for. It appears
that one hundred thousand freedmen are already engaged
in the military service as soldiers or laborers.
Others will continue to be engaged in this way. These
are all naturally and logically under the charge of the
War Department; nor do they need the superintendence
of the proposed bureau. The Act of Congress
equalizing their condition in the army of the United
States is better for them than any bureau.</p>

<p>2. But there will remain the other larger class, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
in the main of women and children and farm
laborers, who must find employment on the abandoned
lands. To this labor they are accustomed. These lands
are their natural home. But this class must naturally
and logically come under the charge of the department
which has charge of the abandoned lands. Conceding
that all in the military service fall under the superintendence
of the War Department, it follows with
equal reason that all who labor on the lands must fall
under the superintendence of the Treasury Department,
so long, at least, as this department has charge of the
lands.</p>

<p>This conclusion seems so reasonable that your Committee
were not able to resist it. But the testimony
of persons who have given particular attention to the
question is also explicit; so that experience is in harmony
with reason. I have in my hands a letter from
Colonel McKaye, an eminent citizen of New York, and
also a member of the Commission to inquire and report
on this subject, appointed by the Secretary of War.
After visiting South Carolina and Louisiana, expressly
to study the necessities of freedmen, and to ascertain
what could be done to benefit them, he thus expresses
himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>In the first place</em>, everybody who has had any <em>practical
experience</em> of the working of the plantations or of the superintendence
of negro labor will tell you that <em>the control of the
abandoned plantations and the care of the colored people must
be in the same hands</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>You will not fail to observe how positively this <em>expert</em>
speaks. According to him, all who have had “practical
experience” insist that the care of the freedmen and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the plantations should be “in the same hands”; and so
important does he regard this point that he places it
first in consideration.</p>

<p>But Colonel McKaye is not alone. Here is a letter
from Hon. Robert Dale Owen, Chairman of the Commission
on Freedmen, appointed by the Secretary of
War, which testifies as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It will never do to have Treasury agents who lease the
lands to white men, and War Department agents who assign
the same lands to colored people. Nothing but confusion
and conflict of authority can result. It will not work at all.
But even if it would, why employ two sets of agents to do
what one set can do much better? And who is to inspect
the leased plantations, and see to it that neither employers
nor employed are wronged? The men who gave the leases?
But they are Treasury agents, and have nothing to do with
freedmen. Or the Freedmen’s Commissioners? But what
authority can they have over men who do not hold their
leases from them? <em>The men who have the care of the laborer
ought to have the leasing of the land and the inspection of the
leases</em>; and they should be authorized to lease equally to
white and to colored people.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such a statement is an argument.</p>

<p>This conclusion has the support also of General Banks,
in a letter addressed to one of the Freedmen’s Commission.
Here are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The assignment of the abandoned or forfeited plantations
to one department of the Government, and the protection
and support of the emancipated people to another, <em>is a
fundamental error productive of incalculable evils, and cannot
be too soon or too thoroughly corrected</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The able and elaborate report from the Freedme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>n’s
Commission, just published, considers this question carefully.
Nothing could be more explicit than the following
testimony.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But, in the judgment of the Commission, the most serious
error in connection with the present arrangements for the care
and protection of these people <em>arises out of the assignment to a
different agency of the care and disposal of the abandoned plantations</em>.
To enter into the detail of all the evils and abuses
that have arisen out of this error, and which are unavoidable
so long as it continues to exist, would occupy too great
a space in this report. Suffice it to say, that it is the source
of the greatest confusion and a perpetual collision between
the different local authorities, in which not only the emancipated
population, but the Government itself, suffers the most
serious injuries and losses.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“And this is the purport of all the testimony which the
Commission has been able to obtain, not in the department
of the Gulf only, but everywhere, in relation to this matter.</p>

<p>“The unhesitating judgment of every person, official or
other, not interested in the opportunities it affords for peculation,
with whom we have consulted, coincides with that of
General Banks. All, without exception, declare that no system
can avail to effect the great objects contemplated that
does not assign to one and the same authority the care and
disposal of the abandoned plantations and the care and protection
of the emancipated laborers who are to cultivate
them.</p>

<p>“<em>And, after the most thorough investigations, I am authorized
in saying that this is the deliberate judgment of the Commission.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was on this ground of reason, and yielding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
influence of such authoritative opinions, that the Committee
were led to believe that there was no alternative
on this practical question.</p>

<p>In the course of their inquiries the Committee sought
the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury. With
the heavy burdens of his department resting on his
shoulders, he does not desire any additional labor; but
he does not conceal his conviction that the care of the
freedmen must for the present be associated with the
care of the lands. He would be glad to be relieved of
all the responsibilities connected with the subject, but
he hopes that it will not be divided between two different
departments. In that event it is feared that there
will be little good from either.</p>

<p>I have dwelt with some minuteness on this question,
because it seems to be the practical point on which
there may be difference of opinion. Already gentlemen
have taken sides, and newspapers also. I regret this
difference, but I trust that a calm and dispassionate
consideration of the subject will render it innocuous.
The first thought of all should be for the freedmen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is another point, which ought not to be passed
over in silence, arising from the just desire to protect
the freedmen from any system of serfdom or enforced
apprenticeship. It is well known that among
former slave-masters there are many who continue to
count upon appropriating the labor of their slaves, if
not under the name of Slavery, at least under some
other system by which freedmen shall be effectually
held to service. This very phrase “held to service,”
standing alone, is the pleonastic definition of Slavery
itself. One of these slave-masters, in a public speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
said: “There is really no difference, in my opinion,
whether we hold them as absolute slaves or obtain their
labor by some other method. Of course we prefer the
old method; but that question is not now before us.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
Such barefaced avowals were not needed to put humane
men on their guard against the conspiracy to continue
Slavery under another name.</p>

<p>The bill before the Senate provides against any such
possibility by requiring that the assistant commissioners
and local superintendents shall not only aid the
freedmen in the adjustment of their wages, but shall
take care that they do not suffer from ill-treatment or
any failure of contract on the part of others,&mdash;and
also that the contracts for service shall be limited to
a year. The latter provision is so important that I give
it precisely.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That no freedmen shall be held to service on
any estate above mentioned otherwise than according to voluntary
contract, reduced to writing, and certified by the assistant
commissioner or local superintendent; nor shall any
such contract be for a longer period than twelve months.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a safeguard against serfdom or enforced apprenticeship
which seemed to the Committee of especial
value. In this respect the House bill was thought to be
fatally defective, inasmuch as it interposed no positive
safeguards.</p>

<p>I do not know how extensive the desire may be to
set Slavery again on its feet under another name. But
when we take into consideration the selfish tendencies
of business, the disposition of the strong to appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the labor of the weak, and the reluctance of slave-masters
to renounce habitual power, I have felt that
Congress would fail in its duty, if it did not by special
provision guard against any such outrage. There must
be no Slavery under an <i>alias</i>. This infinite wrong must
not be allowed to skulk in serfdom or compulsory labor.
“Once free, always free,”&mdash;such is the maxim of justice
and jurisprudence. But any system by which the freedmen
may be annexed to the soil, like the old <i>adscripti
glebæ</i>, will be in direct conflict with their newly acquired
rights. They can be properly bound only by contract;
and considering how easily they may be induced to
enter into engagements ignorantly or heedlessly, and
thus become the legal victims of designing men, it is
evident that no precautions in their behalf can be too
great.</p>

<p>It is well known that in some of the British West
Indies an attempt was made, at the period of emancipation,
to establish a system of apprenticeship, which
should be an intermediate condition between Slavery
and Freedom. But the experiment failed. In some
of the islands it was abandoned by the planters themselves,
who frankly accepted emancipation outright;
and in all it finally fell before the irresistible eloquence
of Brougham. Here is a passage from one of
his speeches.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They who always dreaded Emancipation, who were
alarmed at the prospect of negro indolence, who stood aghast
at the vision of negro rebellion, should the chains cease to
rattle or the lash to resound through the air, gathering no
wisdom from the past, still persist in affrighting themselves
and scaring you with imaginary apprehensions from the
transition to entire freedom out of the present intermediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>state. But that intermediate state is the very source of
all their real danger; and I disguise not its magnitude from
myself. You have gone too far, if you stop here and go no
farther; <em>you are in imminent hazard, if, having loosened the
fetters, you do not strike them off</em>,&mdash;if, leaving them ineffectual
to restrain, you let them remain to gall and to irritate
and to goad. Beware of that state, yet more unnatural than
slavery itself, <em>liberty bestowed by halves</em>.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“I have demonstrated to you that everything is ordered,
every previous step taken, all safe, by experience shown to
be safe, for the long desired consummation. The time has
come, the trial has been made, the hour is striking; you
have no longer a pretext for hesitation or faltering or delay.
The slave has shown, by four years’ blameless behavior and
devotion to the pursuits of peaceful industry, that he is as
fit for his freedom as any English peasant, ay, or any lord
whom I now address. I demand his rights,&mdash;<em>I demand his
liberty without stint</em>,&mdash;in the name of justice and of law, in
the name of reason, in the name of God, who has given you
no right to work injustice.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But surely there is no need of eloquence or persuasion
to induce you to set your faces like flint against any
such half-way system. Freedom already declared must
be secured completely, so that it may not fail through
any pretension or fraud of wicked men. The least that
can be done is what is proposed by your Committee.</p>

<p>Much more might be said on the whole subject; but
I forbear. I have opened to consideration the two principal
questions. If the Senate agree with the Committee,
first, on the importance of keeping the superintendence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of the freedmen and of lands in the same hands, so as
to avoid local conflict and discord, and, secondly, in the
importance of providing surely against any system of
serfdom or adscription to the soil, the bill of the Committee
must be adopted.</p>

<p>For the sake of plainness, I ask attention to the general
character of the bill in its main features.</p>

<p>1. It provides exclusively for freedmen, meaning
thereby “such persons as have once been slaves,” without
undertaking to embrace persons generally of African
descent.</p>

<p>2. It seeks to secure for such freedmen the opportunity
of labor on those lands which are natural and
congenial to them, and on this account it places superintendence
of the freedmen in a department having
superintendence of the lands.</p>

<p>3. It provides positively against any system of enforced
labor or apprenticeship, by requiring contracts
between the freedmen and their employers to be carefully
attested before local officers.</p>

<p>4. It establishes careful machinery for the purposes
of the bill, both as regards freedmen and as regards
lands.</p>

<p>But the bill is seen not only in what it does, but also
in what it avoids doing.</p>

<p>It does not undertake too much. It does not assume
to provide ways and means for the support of the freedmen;
but it does look to securing them the opportunities
of labor according to well-guarded contracts and
under the friendly advice of agents of the Government,
who will take care that they are protected from abuse
of all kinds.</p>

<p>It is the declared duty of the agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> “to protect
these persons in the enjoyment of their rights, to promote
their welfare, and to secure to them and their posterity
the blessings of liberty.” Under these comprehensive
words all that is proper and constitutional is
authorized for their welfare and security, while labor is
made to go hand in hand. Thus far in the sad history
of this people labor has been compelled by Slavery.
But the case at last will be reversed. It is Liberty that
will conduct the freedman to the fields, protect him in
his toil, and secure to him all its fruits.</p>

<p>In closing what I have to say on this subject, allow
me to read the official testimony of the Commission on
Freedmen, appointed by the Secretary of War, in their
recent report.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For a time we need a Freedmen’s Bureau,&mdash;but not because
these people are negroes, only because they are men
who have been for generations despoiled of their rights.
The Commission has heretofore&mdash;to wit, in the Supplemental
Report made to you in December last&mdash;recommended
the establishment of such a bureau; and they believe
that all that is essential to its proper organization is
contained, substantially, in a bill to that effect, reported, on
April 12, from the Senate Committee on Slavery and Freedmen.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is the bill before us.</p>

<p>It is for the Senate to determine, under the circumstances,
what it will do. My earnest hope is that it
will do something. The opportunity must not be lost
of helping so many persons now helpless, and of aiding
the cause of reconciliation, without which peace cannot
be assured. In this spirit I leave the whole subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the judgment of the Senate. If anything better than
the work of the Committee can be found, I hope it will
be adopted; meanwhile I ask you to accept what is now
offered.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After various amendments moved by Mr. Sumner, the bill was violently
opposed by Mr. Richardson, of Illinois. In the course of his
speech the following colloquy occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Richardson.</span> The Senator from Massachusetts will be able to
carry his proposition next winter, if the people can be deceived to reëlect
Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I hope this summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Richardson.</span> You have no show in the world this summer. If
you could carry that proposition now, you could not carry one of the Northwestern
States this fall.</p>

</div>

<p>June 14th, the consideration of the bill was renewed, when Mr.
Hendricks, of Indiana, spoke against it. He moved to strike out
“Treasury Department,” and insert “Department of the Interior.”
On this motion Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The point to which the Senator directs attention was
considered very carefully by the Committee. Were this
a moment of peace, I believe the Committee would have
been unanimous in the idea of the Senator. Indeed, it
seems to me, the reasons for it in time of peace are
unanswerable. It is in the Interior Department that
we place the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of
Pensions, the Bureau of Patents, the Bureau of Public
Lands; and a Bureau of Freedmen would be more or
less germane to all these interests. It would naturally
be lodged in the same department with them. Naturally
it belongs to the Interior; there can be no question
about it. The Senator, therefore, is perfectly right,
when he makes the suggestion. But the Senator should
take into consideration that at this moment we are acting
provisionally, and not permanently,&mdash;under suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
growing out of the present state of the country,
and not as if we were in a condition of permanent
peace.</p>

<p>In placing the bureau where the Committee have
placed it, they followed what seemed the necessities of
the case. Congress, by previous legislation, has practically
placed the bureau in the Treasury Department,&mdash;or
rather it has rendered it necessary that it should be
placed there, unless we are willing by legislation to create
a conflict between two different departments. Congress
has already placed in the Treasury Department
the control of the business relations between the Rebel
States and the Loyal States, and also the control of the
abandoned lands and plantations in the Rebel States.
Now, as I tried to exhibit the other day, when I opened
this question, the main interest for the moment is how
to bring the freedmen in connection with the lands. If
you go beyond that, if you undertake to provide means
for their support, you assume what I believe the country
does not expect you to assume, and what I believe those
who have the welfare of that people most at heart do
not venture to counsel. We desire to secure for them
opportunity,&mdash;opportunity to work: that is the main
point, and that can be secured only by bringing them
in connection with the lands. The care and guardianship
of the lands where it is proposed to place the freedmen
have already, by previous legislation, I repeat, been
lodged with the Treasury Department. Therefore, naturally
and logically, it seems to follow, unless you are
willing to create a conflict between two different departments,
or between the agents of two different departments,
that you should place the care of the freedmen
in the same department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I am not alone in this view. The other day I
presented it, and gave opinions on the subject, to which
I now call attention: one is a private letter from Hon.
Robert Dale Owen, and the other is part of the Report
of the Freedmen’s Commission, appointed by the Secretary
of War to consider, among other questions, that
now before the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Hendricks was rejected. Mr. Willey, of West
Virginia, then spoke against the bill. He said: “In my opinion, after
as close and careful an examination of this bill as I have been able to
give to it, its proper title would be ‘A bill to reënslave freedmen.’ …
Sir, in the name of Liberty and Emancipation I protest against the
passage of any such bill by the American Senate.”</p>

<p>June 15th, the debate was continued, when the bill was opposed by
Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, Mr. Hicks, of Maryland, and Mr. Grimes,
of Iowa. Mr. Ten Eyck, of New Jersey, spoke in favor of it. Mr.
Carlile, of Virginia, moved to postpone its further consideration to the
first Monday of December next, which was lost,&mdash;Yeas 13, Nays 23.
Mr. Grimes was particularly severe in his criticism, which drew from
Mr. Sumner the following reply.</p>

</div>

<p>I am sorry that I am obliged to say another word in
this debate. I had hoped to be excused. But the remarks
of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>] leave me
no alternative.</p>

<p>I am not astonished at the opposition this bill has
encountered from Senators over the way. It is their
vocation to oppose every such measure, and to give it, if
possible, a bad name. They believe in Slavery more or
less, and will not do anything to remove it or to mitigate
its terrible curse. There is the Senator from West Virginia
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Willey</span>], who gives us smooth words for
Freedom, with boasts of the slaves he has emancipated,
and then straightway, by voice and vote, sustains slave-hunting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and, if possible, worse still, startles the Senate
by a menace that slaves set free by Act of Congress will
be reënslaved by States restored to the Union. That
this Senator should attack a bill for a Bureau of Freedmen
is perfectly natural; nor am I astonished that he
should misrepresent its character. But I cannot conceal
my surprise at the course of the Senator from Iowa,
who I know has no love for Slavery, and no congenital,
persistent, and rooted prejudices against the colored
race. If the Senator from West Virginia spoke naturally,
allow me to say that my friend from Iowa spoke
unnaturally.</p>

<p>Sir, the Senator has not done justice to the bill he
undertook to criticize. It was evident that he spoke
hastily, without having even read it. At least, this is
not an improper assumption, when we consider some of
his criticisms. It will be remembered how promptly
I corrected him, while he was picturing the Assistant
Commissioners as so utterly without restraint that they
were not even obliged to make reports. I rose and read
the clause in the bill expressly requiring not only
“quarterly reports,” but “other special reports from time
to time.” The Senator, surprised by this provision, replied,
that it was at the close of the bill, and was evidently
an afterthought. This, again, was a mistake.
Had he read the bill carefully, he would have found,
that, whatever its merits in other respects, everything is
introduced in its proper place, and this provision is no
exception. There is no afterthought in the bill. The
Senator then complained that the Assistant Commissioner
was not obliged to give a bond. Here, again, he
was mistaken. By an amendment moved by myself
this was required. All this was part of the attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
show that the bureau had not been planned with sufficient
care. Suffice it to say that there is no bureau
of the Government constituted with more care, or surrounded
with more safeguards against abuse. Much, in
the last resort, must be confided to the honesty of public
servants; but in the present case they are all placed
under the observation of their superiors. Superintendents
will be observed by the Assistant Commissioner,
who will be observed by the Commissioner, and all will
be under the observation of the Secretary of the Treasury,
who himself is under the observation of the President;
and I need not add that the whole will be subject
to the oversight of a humane and enlightened people,
awakening daily to a sense of obligation which cannot
be postponed.</p>

<p>I am not wrong, then, when I say that the Senator
did injustice to the bill in his criticism on its structure
and the machinery it establishes. But this was the
smallest part of his injustice. He went further, and,
following the Senator from West Virginia, asserted that
it gave the Commissioner unlimited power and control,
so as to hand the unhappy freedman over to Slavery
under another name. I looked at the Senator to see
if he were really serious, as he made this strange accusation
against a measure conceived in a sentiment of
humanity and equity, and, by positive provisions, guarding
every freedman against the very outrage which the
Senator professes to fear. He seemed to be serious, as
he repeated the accusation. But as he had erred with
regard to the restraints upon the Assistant Commissioners,
so he erred in the graver impeachment which
he launched here.</p>

<p>The Senator began by saying that the bill, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to its definition of freedmen, was applicable to all “once
slaves,” and that even Robert Small, the patriot slave
who navigated the “Planter” out of Charleston and gave
it to us, would come under its provisions. Very well.
Suppose he does. Can he suffer from it? Does he lose
anything by it? Can anybody under this bill exercise
any power or control over Robert Small? The Senator
forgets that the bill assumes that all are free, and in
every respect entitled to all the privileges of freemen,&mdash;that
they are invested with every right the Senator
himself possesses, and, if these rights are violated, they
may look for a remedy to any court of justice precisely
as he could. None of these rights are infringed.
On the contrary, the officers under the bill are charged
to see that the freedmen are secure in their rights;
so that Robert Small himself, if the occasion required,
might find aid and protection under it. The bill gives
no power to take away or limit existing rights; but
it provides additional means for their safeguard, that
emancipation may be perfect, so far as possible.</p>

<p>I do not like to take time, especially when I consider
that in opening this matter to the Senate I explained the
character of the bill and its necessity. I do not pretend
that it is perfect; but I beg to assure the Senate that
it is the result of the careful deliberations of the Committee.
If Senators are disposed to criticize it, or to
offer amendments with a view to its improvement, let
them do so. But I trust that they will not allow themselves
to be carried into any general hostility founded
on misconception of its real character. I might remind
them again of the large numbers of freedmen&mdash;free,
thank God, by legislative and executive acts of
the United States, but not yet introduced into the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
condition appointed for them&mdash;unemployed, suffering,
starving, and, with a voice of agony, calling for relief.
I might remind them of the inability of private charity,
or any effort organized by private individuals, to meet
all the exigencies of this unprecedented case, although
the generosity of our people is overflowing. I might
dwell on the obligation of the nation, reaching everywhere
with its hundred arms, to do what inferior charity
must fail to do; and I might especially show that
it is not enough to strike down the master, but that you
must go further, and lift up the slave. But I forbear,
contenting myself with reminding you, that, if you oppose
legislation to help the freedmen in their rough
passage from Slavery to Freedom, you hand over this
unhappy people&mdash;unhappy for long generations, and
not yet conducted into the full enjoyment of their
rights&mdash;to a condition which I dread to contemplate.
They look about and find no home. They seek occupation,
but it is not within their reach. They ask
for protection, sometimes against former taskmasters,
and sometimes against other selfish men. If these are
not supplied in some way by the Government, I know
not where to look for them. Surely, Sir, you will not
hesitate to provide, so far as you can, carefully and
wisely, the proper means to secure employment for
them during the transition from one condition to another,
and, above all, to throw over them everywhere
the ægis of Constitution and Law. And such, permit
me to say, is the single supreme object of the present
bill, which has been so cordially misrepresented
by the Senator from West Virginia, and so strangely
misrepresented by my friend from Iowa.</p>

<p>I have said that the object was care and protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
for persons actually free, and so regarded, who, from the
peculiarity of their condition, might not be able in all
respects to secure these without assistance. To this end
a central agency is proposed at Washington, with subordinate
agencies where the freedmen are to be found,
devoted to this work of watching over emancipation, so
that it may be surrounded with a congenial atmosphere.
Is not the object worthy of support? Who will question
it?</p>

<p>The language of the bill describing the functions of
the Commissioner is plain and explicit; and yet out of
this language, so guarded and so utterly inoffensive, the
Senator from Iowa has conjured a phantom to frighten
the Senate from its propriety. Why, Sir, if there were
anything which by possibility could justify the fears
of the Senator, if there were anything which even the
most lively imagination could exaggerate into a lack of
care and protection, then I should be the first to denounce
it, and to ask forgiveness for an unconscious
aberration. But there is absolutely nothing; and if
you listen to the bill, you will agree with me.</p>

<p>I begin with the very words which to the Senator
from Iowa were so alarming:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Commissioner, under the direction of the Secretary
of the Treasury, shall have the general superintendence of all
freedmen throughout the several departments.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here are duties imposed upon the Commissioner; but
there is no power or control over the freedmen. Calling
a man superintendent gives him no power except in
conformity with law; but all the laws, general and special,
are for Freedom. And yet the Senator has repeated,
again and again, that this was a grant of unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
power and control over the freedmen. To his mind here
was an overflowing fountain of tyranny and wrong.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> Will the Senator tell the Senate what is
meant by it?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> With great pleasure; and if I can have
the candid attention of my friend, I believe that he and
I cannot differ, for I will not doubt that we have the
same object at heart. Obviously the language indicates
in a general way the character of the duties to be
performed. They are duties of superintendence, but we
are to look elsewhere for the extent of the duties; and
the words which follow in the same section show something
of their nature. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And it shall be his duty especially <em>to watch over</em> the
execution of all laws, proclamations, and military orders of
emancipation, or in any way concerning freedmen.”</p>

</div>

<p>There, Sir, is the first glimpse of this tyrant. Mark,
Sir, there is not one word of power or control over the
freedmen, but duties solemnly imposed, all in behalf of
Freedom. What next?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And generally, by careful regulations in the spirit of the
Constitution, <em>to protect these persons in the enjoyment of their
rights</em>, to promote their welfare, and to secure to them and
their posterity the blessings of liberty.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here, again, are duties of the Commissioner; but
there is not one word conferring power or control
over the freedmen. The main object is protection in
the enjoyment of their rights,&mdash;inborn, but new-found.
This is to be crowned by such watchfulness as will promote
their welfare and secure to them and their posterity
the blessings of liberty; and all this is to be according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
to “careful regulations.” To find tyranny in
this provision the Senator must be as critical as the
German theologian who found heresy in the Lord’s
Prayer. I do not go to the dictionary for the meaning
of superintendent. This is needless. Obviously,
the superintendent must superintend according to law;
and since this is now for Freedom, whatever he does
must be for Freedom likewise. He can do nothing
without this inspiration. The function of superintendence
is not applicable exclusively to this case. It is
of common occurrence. There is a superintendent of
emigrants; but nobody supposes that he can do anything
with regard to emigrants except in conformity
with law. The mayor of Washington is, in a certain
sense, a superintendent of the Senator and myself, as
we walk the streets or lie down at night in our houses,
bound to see that we are protected from outrage and
robbery. And the Vice-President, or the President of
the Senate, is a superintendent of this Chamber, bound
to see that the rules of Parliamentary Law are observed.
But the Senator would not think of attributing to either
of these functionaries that “unlimited control and power”
which he dreaded in the superintendent of freedmen,&mdash;bound
to see that freedmen are protected in
their rights. And yet it exists in one case just as
much as in the other.</p>

<p>I think, Sir, that after this explanation there can be
no difficulty in answering the inquiry of the Senator.
By “superintendence of all freedmen” is meant that
watchfulness of their rights and interests consistent
with laws, general and special, for their protection,
welfare, and liberty, so that they may be helped to
employment and be guarded against outrage. The object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
is good. What other word would the Senator employ
to designate it? How would he describe the humane
function of the Commissioner? He is versed in
language. Will he supply any term more apt? I invite
him to do it, and shall gladly accept it. Since we
seem to concur in the object, let there be no difference
on account of words. All I desire is something that
shall supply help and protection. For this I cheerfully
sacrifice the rest. And permit me to say, I have misread
this bill, if there is a single word in it, from beginning
to end, which can give the most remote apology
for any other idea.</p>

<p>I have thus far only glanced at a single section.
Look further. I pass for the moment the next section,
and go to the sixth, which describes some of the
duties of the “Assistant Commissioners and local superintendents.”
It begins by declaring that they&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Shall act as <em>advisory guardians to aid</em> the freedmen in
the adjustment of their wages, or, where they have rented
plantations or small holdings, in the application of their
labor.”</p>

</div>

<p>Observe, if you please, the friendly service to be performed.
Not in this way do tyrants or slave-masters
wield a wicked power. Here is advice, guardianship,
and the adjustment of wages,&mdash;all inconsistent with
Slavery in any of its pretensions. What next?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That they shall take care that the freedmen do not suffer
from ill-treatment or any failure of contract on the part of
others, and that on their part they perform their duty under
any contract entered into by them.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mark, again, the friendly service. Here is another
duty cast upon these officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> How is that to be enforced? Suppose they
will not work,&mdash;will not fulfil their contracts?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The duty of these officers is “advisory.”
They are not invested with power to enforce any provisions,
unless by court of law or some other tribunal.
The freedmen are entitled to all the rights of freemen,
just as much as the Senator. Curiously, the Senator
does not seem to have purged his mind of the idea that
these men, in some way or other, have not yet ceased to
be slaves,&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> No.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;an assumption which, however natural in the Senator
from West Virginia, is not natural in my friend
from Iowa. Let him recognize them as free, like himself,
and he will see that there is no remedy open to
him which is not open to them, and that any outrage
upon them is, in point of law, the same as if inflicted
upon himself.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Harlan.</span> I desire to ask the Senator if there are
courts of law in existence in these Rebel States before whom
the parties may appear.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am afraid that courts of justice in those
States are not yet in perfect operation. But such as they
are, they will be open to every freedman. On this point
there can be no question.</p>

<p>The next words show what shall be done by these
officers to promote the administration of justice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They shall further do what they can as <em>arbitrators</em> to
reconcile and settle any differences in which freedmen may be
involved, whether among themselves or between themselves
and other persons.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the duty of arbitrator and peacemaker, but
no power or control. And this duty is applicable to
differences of all kinds, where the freedmen are parties.
Nothing can be more humane or less tyrannical. This
is not all.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In case such differences are carried before any tribunal,
civil or military, they shall appear as next friends of the
freedmen, so far as to see that the case is fairly stated and
heard. And in all such proceedings there shall be no disability
or exclusion on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>If not “arbitrators,” then the officers are to be “next
friends,” to aid the freedmen in any litigation into which
they may be drawn. Very little tyranny here. And
this service is to be rendered in any tribunal, “civil or
military”; so that, where the civil courts are closed, the
freedmen may obtain justice in any military tribunal.
But whether in a civil or military tribunal, there is to
be no disability or exclusion on account of color. When
we consider how this disability and exclusion have been
the badge of Slavery and its pretensions, we may find
in their positive prohibition a new token of the spirit in
which this bill is conceived. Very little tyranny here.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> But, Mr. President, the case that was put
by me was not where there was a controversy between the
colored man and some third party, but where the Commissioner
attempted to enforce the obligation of duty upon the
colored man.… Now I want to know of the Senator if a
Commissioner who undertakes to carry out the provisions of
this bill may not, under the third section, avail himself of
the military authority that may be in the department to enforce
obedience,&mdash;and if he thinks it would be doing justice
to the colored men in the department to leave them to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>military control of the Commissioner, of whom we know
nothing, and about whom we do not know whether he sympathises
with the colored man or not. Is it right to leave
these colored men to the military control of this Commissioner
in order to enforce the obligation to labor?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator calls attention to another
section, where it is provided that “the military commander
within any department shall, on the application
of the Assistant Commissioner thereof, supply all needful
military support in the discharge of the duties of
such Assistant Commissioner”; and he inquires if this
does not authorize the Assistant Commissioner to use
military power in making freedmen work. Let me say
at once that the criticism of the Senator is absolutely
novel. If the clause to which he refers could be
employed to any such purpose, I beg to assure him
it was not anticipated by the Committee. It was intended
for a very different purpose, and in the interest
of the freedman. Here, again, I remind the Senator
that nothing can be done by any officer, military or
civil, toward a freedman, which cannot be done toward
any other citizen. If this military power can be used
against one, it can be equally used against the other.
The occasion for this power seemed obvious. It was
supposed that in the Rebel States there might be exposed
districts where the plantations would be subject
to incursion or ravage from the enemy, by which labor
would be obstructed or disturbed, unless military protection
were at hand. To remedy evils of that character
this provision was introduced. Such is the object
sought to be accomplished. It is protection, in the spirit
of the whole bill, and nothing else. If by any possibility
there can be the chance of an abuse of this power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
beyond what is incident to every trust, I shall be
glad to take advantage of the criticism of the Senator,
and amend the bill so that the evil he snuffs afar shall
not be permitted to arrive.</p>

<p>The Senator cannot bear the thought of freedmen exposed
to the tyranny of military power. But does he
not forget that at this moment they are subject to this
tyranny? It is to remove them from all this arbitrary
control and uncertain protection that we establish a
bureau, which shall be an agency of the civil power,
charged to surround the freedmen with every safeguard
the Constitution and laws can supply. Show me any
provision in one or the other for the protection of human
rights, and I claim it at once for the freedman against
any oppressor, whatever his office or name.</p>

<p>Let the Senator bear these things in mind, and give
us the advantage of his counsels. I shall welcome from
him any suggestion, any proposition, any criticism, calculated
to promote the object of the bill. The more he
makes, the better. Let him be no niggard. But I trust
he will pardon me, if I complain of inconsiderate assault,
which, as it seems to me, can have no other effect
than to injure the cause.</p>

<p>I have not done with the criticism of the Senator.
It was on the fifth section, concerning the labor on
abandoned plantations, that he bent his chief force. In
the provisions of that section he found a new system of
Slavery: sometimes it was Slavery outright, and sometimes
it was Peon Slavery. Senators who did me the
honor of listening to my remarks at the beginning of
this debate will remember how I dwelt upon the importance
of guarding against any revival of Slavery
under any other name, whether of apprenticeship or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
adscription to the soil; and they may remember, perhaps,
how I explained the impossibility of any such
occurrence under the present bill, and showed that the
freedman was guarded at all points. And yet, in the
face of this exposition, and of the positive text,&mdash;better
than any exposition,&mdash;the cry is sounded, that the
liberty of the freedman is in danger. The Senator read
this section at length, and then sounded again particular
clauses and phrases, striving to interpret them for
Slavery. I will not read it at length; nor will I dwell
on the first part of the section. Suffice it to say, that,
so far as it describes the lands to be taken for occupation,
it follows substantially the text of the order from
the War Department, by which “all houses, tenements,
lands, and plantations, except such as may be required
for military purposes, which have been or may be deserted
and abandoned by insurgents within the lines of
the military occupation,” are placed under the supervision
and control of the supervising special agents of the
Treasury Department. Under this order the Secretary
of the Treasury has been acting for several months,&mdash;doing
with these lands precisely what the Senator so
vehemently condemns. The present bill, so far as concerns
the power of the Commissioner over the lands,
does little more than reduce the order of the War Department
to the text of a statute, thus imparting to it
a certain legality which it does not now possess.</p>

<p>Passing from the lands to be occupied under the bill,
the Senator next pictures the terrible fate of the freedmen
laboring on these lands in pursuance of careful
contracts. There seems no limit to the Senator’s anxiety
lest they should be bound in Slavery. I welcome his
generous solicitude. But I pray that he will not allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
it to mislead his judgment or prevent him from seeing
the case in its true character. Surely he must be unduly
excited, or he could not find danger in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In case no proper lessees can be found, then to cause the
same to be cultivated or occupied by the freedmen, on such
terms, in either case, and under such regulations, as the
Commissioner may determine.”</p>

</div>

<p>“What a frightful power!” exclaimed the Senator.
But why? Here is no power or control over the freedmen,
but simply over the lands, which the officers cause
to be cultivated or occupied. These officers are representatives
of the National Government, to which the
lands belong for the time being, and, in determining the
terms and regulations under which they are to be cultivated
or occupied, they do no more than is done by the
Senator with regard to the lands he is so happy in owning.
The Senator fixes the terms and regulations under
which his lands are leased or cultivated: does he not?
And he would be surprised, if any person called in
question his rights in this regard; especially would he
be surprised, if any person undertook to infer that the
freedom of laborers upon his lands could be compromised
by any terms or regulations he might choose to
make. But there is no power he may exercise over his
own lands that may not now be exercised by the Government.
In each case the laborer must be treated as
a freeman. The Senator seems to imagine that there is
power or control over the freedmen conferred by these
words. Here is his mistake. The power and control
are over the lands, not over the freedmen. There is not
a word in the clause that can be tortured into any such
idea. I challenge the Senator to point it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far I have considered this clause, which according
to the Senator is so terribly pregnant, without
alluding to the express limitation following in the same
section. Even without this limitation it is clear and
blameless. But the Committee, in order to make assurance
doubly sure, and to set up an absolute impediment
against any abuse, have added the following proviso:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That no freedmen shall be held to service on
any estate above mentioned otherwise than according to voluntary
contract, reduced to writing, and certified by the Assistant
Commissioner or local superintendent; nor shall any
such contract be for a longer period than twelve months.”</p>

</div>

<p>And yet, in the face of this proviso, the Senator sees
danger. Nobody can be found on the lands except in
pursuance of voluntary contract, which must be reduced
to writing and certified by an officer of the Government.
Nor is this all. The contract is not to be for a term
beyond twelve months; so that, by no excuse, and by no
exercise of power, can the freedman be put even under
a shadow of control beyond this brief term. He is in
all respects a freeman, laboring on lands according to
careful contract for a limited period. And yet the
Senator calls this beneficent arrangement Slavery, and
then, changing the name, he calls it Peonage. Sir, the
Senator has an imperfect conception of that peonage
which is indefinite service, or of that slavery which
is service for endless generations, if he undertakes to
liken employment in pursuance of contract most carefully
guarded for a term of a few months to either of
these wretched conditions.</p>

<p>But all this is only part of the mistake in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Senator has proceeded from beginning to end. I am at
a loss to account for it. I do not understand it. That
I regret it most sincerely I need not say. I counted
upon his charitable regard for this bill. I felt sure
of his sympathy with its general objects. I do not renounce
the hope of this sympathy now. But I cannot
forbear saying, that, to my mind, the Senator throws
himself in the way of a humane undertaking, and practically
abandons the claims of the oppressed race to
which he and I both owe service. Long have they
suffered, much have they been abused, wearily have
they journeyed through life; and now, at last, when
Slavery is overturned, and we seek to provide a passage
from its torments to a better condition, where labor
shall be quickened and protected by Liberty, and
where all rights shall be respected, it is hard to find
our efforts buffeted by a cross-wind from such an unexpected
quarter.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Grimes and Mr. Willey followed. Between the latter and Mr.
Sumner there was an earnest passage.</p>

<p>June 27th, the consideration of the bill was again resumed, when
other amendments moved by Mr. Sumner were adopted, among which
was the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And every such freedman shall be treated in every respect as a freeman,
with all proper remedies in courts of justice; and no power or control shall
be exercised with regard to him, except in conformity with law.”</p>

</div>

<p>Several Senators spoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 28th, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, moved to strike out
“Treasury” and insert “War.” Mr. Sumner again explained the
preference of the Committee at length, when Mr. Wilson withdrew his
motion; but it was afterwards renewed by Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of
Maryland, and rejected,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 20. Other motions ensued,
with speeches. The substitute of the Committee having been adopted,
the bill was then passed,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 9,&mdash;with the title,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> “An
Act to establish a Bureau of Freedmen.”</p>

<p>July 2d, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Eliot, from the Select
Committee on Emancipation, moved that the House should not concur
with the substitute of the Senate, when, on motion of Mr. Griswold, the
whole subject was postponed to December 20th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>December 20, 1864, in the House of Representatives, the bill being
under consideration, according to the postponement from the last
session, Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, and
Mr. Noble, of Ohio, were appointed a Committee of Conference. The
Senate agreed to the Conference, and Mr. Sumner, Mr. Howard, of
Michigan, and Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, were appointed on the
part of the Senate. A new bill was reported. Instead of attaching
the bureau to the War Department or to the Treasury Department, an
independent department was created, called a Department of Freedmen
and Abandoned Lands; but in other respects it was substantially the
Senate bill.</p>

<p>February 9, 1865, after debate, the report of the Committee was
adopted by the House,&mdash;Yeas 64, Nays 62.</p>

<p>February 10th, Mr. Sumner, on the part of the Committee, reported
the new bill to the Senate, and on the 13th, in answer to inquiry, explained
it as follows.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>,&mdash;I trust that there will be no opposition
to this most important, and, as I solemnly believe,
most beneficent measure. But I shall be happy
to make any explanation with regard to it.</p>

<p>Senators have not forgotten the bill to create a
Bureau of Freedmen, which, after careful debate for
several days, was passed by the Senate at the close of
the last session as a substitute for a House bill. For
some time the difference between the two Houses has
been under the consideration of a Conference Committee,
whose report is now before you. This report embodies
substantially the Senate bill, including various
propositions moved by different Senators,&mdash;among others,
that relating to the forfeiture of estates, moved by
the Senator from Illinois, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>],&mdash;that relating
to the care of freedmen unemployed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
lands, moved by the Senator from West Virginia [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Willey</span>],&mdash;and that relating to trials by courts-martial,
moved by the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>].
All of the Senate bill, in substance, and generally
in language, is preserved, with one single exception.
By the Senate bill a bureau was created in the
Treasury. The Committee of the two Houses unite in
recommending a separate department, holding directly
under the President, and therefore free from the control
of either the Treasury or the War.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the only substantial difference between
the two Houses was on the place where the bureau
should be. Each was for a bureau; but one was for it
in the Treasury, and the other was for it in the Department
of War; and there were strong arguments in favor
of each. There were also strong feelings against each.
Sometimes it was compendiously said that the freedmen
could not be trusted to “the harpies of the Treasury”;
and then again it was said, with equal point, that
they could not be trusted to “the bloodhounds of the
War.” These were exaggerations of opposite opinions;
but they serve to disclose the irreconcilable discord on
the subject.</p>

<p>If the freedmen could have been provided for without
reference to the lands, the question would have been relieved
from much of its embarrassment. But it was the
conviction of the Committee, in which they were sustained
by all most familiar with the matter, that the
care of the freedmen and the care of the abandoned
lands ought to be in the same hands, and that they
could not be separated without exposing the freedmen
to the mischiefs of two conflicting jurisdictions. But
the War Office was not adapted to manage the lands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
as many insisted that the Treasury was not adapted to
manage the freedmen.</p>

<p>There was another consideration not without influence.
It was felt that each of these great departments
of the Government was already so severely burdened,
so weighed down with manifold duties, that it was
hardly in condition to assume a new trust, so grave
and onerous as that proposed.</p>

<p>For such reasons, Sir, and yielding to such influences,
the Committee, after careful and conscientious deliberation,
determined to recommend a new department, not
unlike that of Agriculture, which should not be subject
either to the Treasury or to the War. It was felt that
in doing this they were doing the best for the cause, and
they were not insensible also to the consideration that
in this way they might secure a higher order of talent
and of character for the service. Men fitted for Treasury
agents or fitted for War might not always be the
best for the care of freedmen. The man for this humane
service should be humane by nature, and should
sympathize especially with the race so long neglected
and outraged. They must be versed, if I may so express
myself, in the humanities of the subject.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After quoting the testimony of experts in favor of an independent
department, and of changing the actual system, he concluded.</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the system that now exists, under which
the freedman is the mere accident of the Treasury. Sir,
it is unworthy of the Republic at this great period of
our history.</p>

<p>Already the President, by irrepealable proclamation,
has declared all slaves free. An Amendment to the
Constitution will, in the course of a few weeks, place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
their freedom under the sanction of Constitutional Law.
But this is not enough. The debt of justice will not be
paid, if we do not take them by the hand in their passage
from the house of bondage to the house of freedom:
and this is what is proposed by the present measure.
The temporary care of the freedman is the complement
of Emancipation; but the general welfare is
involved in the performance of this duty. Without it
Emancipation may for a while seem at fault, and the
general welfare gravely suffer.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 14th and 21st, the consideration of the report was continued,&mdash;Mr.
Davis, of Kentucky, Mr. Hendricks, Mr. Grimes, and
Mr. Sprague, of Rhode Island, speaking against it. In reply to Mr.
Grimes, who moved the postponement of its consideration, Mr. Sumner
again vindicated the measure.</p>

</div>

<p>I hope there will be no postponement. A motion to
postpone at the present time is a motion to kill, and
such is the unquestionable object of the Senator from
Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>]. He is against the bill now, just as
he was at the beginning, and is acting according to his
sense of duty, when he tries in every way to defeat it.
But are Senators whose votes have thus far shown a
determination to do something for the freedmen ready
to follow his example?</p>

<p>The Senator says he wishes time. Well. But he
wishes something more. He wishes to arrest this legislation
now at its latest stage. He says that he desires
opportunity for debate. But, Sir, has he not had
this opportunity in largest measure and to excess? The
Senate cannot forget how carefully and conscientiously
this question has been considered: first, in a Committee
of this body, who gave their best attention to it
for weeks, during the last session of Congress; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
for five days and two evenings in the Senate, during
which the Senator signalized his opposition; then again
in a Conference Committee, the present session, where
the whole subject was most thoroughly studied in every
possible light; and now in this debate, running over
several days, which has already occupied the Senate
since the report of that Committee. Surely, if the
Senator is not satisfied with the labors of the Committees
of this body, he cannot complain that opportunity
of debate has been wanting. Sir, he has had
the opportunity, and has exercised it.</p>

<p>I am pained by this opposition. It is out of season.
I am pained by it especially from the Senator from
Iowa. I do not judge him. But he will pardon me, if
I say that from the beginning he has shown a strange
insensibility to this cause. He is for Liberty, but he
will not help us assure it to those who have for generations
been despoiled of it. Sir, I am in earnest. Seriously,
religiously, I accept Emancipation as proclaimed
by the President, and now, by the votes of both Houses
of Congress, placed under the sanction of Constitutional
Law. But even Emancipation is not enough. You
must see to it that it is not nullified or evaded; and you
must see to it especially that the new-made freedmen
are protected in the rights now assured to them, and
that they are saved from the prevailing caste, which
menaces Slavery under some new form; and this is
the object of the present measure.</p>

<p>Would you know the perils of freedmen ever since
Emancipation? Listen, then, to the words of that true
patriot, General Wadsworth, of New York, who, after
his visit to the Valley of the Mississippi, and personal
observation of the freedmen there, testified:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one thing that must be taken into account, and
that is, that there will exist a very strong disposition among
the masters to control these people and keep them as a subordinate
and subjected class. Undoubtedly they intend to
do that. I think the tendency to establish a system of serfdom
is the great danger to be guarded against. I talked
with a planter in the La Fourche district, near Thibodeauville.
He said he was not in favor of secession; he avowed
his hope and expectation that Slavery would be restored
there in some form. I said, ‘If we went away and left these
people now, do you suppose you could reduce them again to
slavery?’ He laughed to scorn the idea that they could
not. ‘What!’ said I, ‘these men who have had arms in
their hands?’ ‘Yes,’ he said; ‘we should take the arms
away from them, of course.’”<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But this emphatic attestation is simply in harmony
with accumulated testimony from other quarters. The
freedmen, rejoicing in recovered rights, must for a while
be saved from the traditional harshness and cruelty to
which for generations they have been exposed. Call it
protection,&mdash;call it what you will: the power of the
Government must be to them a shield. And yet you
hesitate.</p>

<p>The Senator from Iowa renews the objections he
made at an earlier stage. It will not be forgotten that
he most earnestly protested against the bill, as giving
to persons a control of the freedman. It was shown,
I think, to demonstration, that he was mistaken. But,
out of deference to his sensibilities, and that nothing
might seem to be wanting, other safeguards were introduced,
as amendments, on his motion, or in pursuance
of his suggestions. But all this is not enough to
secure his favor. He objects still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>Very well. So far as I understand his objection
then and now, it is twofold: first, that the freedman
is placed under constraint, and that he is not a freeman;
and, secondly, that he is treated too much as
an infant or a pupil. Now I undertake to say that
the objection, in both these forms, is absolutely inapplicable.</p>

<p>The freedman is treated in every respect as a freeman.
Again and again in the bill his rights are secured
to him. Thus, for instance, in the fourth section,
it is expressly provided that “every such freedman shall
be treated in all respects as a free man, with all proper
remedies in courts of justice, and no power or control
shall be exercised with regard to him except in conformity
with law.” Language cannot go further. In
face of these positive words, so completely in harmony
with the whole bill, it is vain to say that the freedman
is not a freeman. Sir, he is a freeman just as much as
the Senator himself, with a title derived from the Almighty,
which no person can assail. When the Senator
finds danger to the freedman, he consults his imagination,
inflamed by hostile sentiments he has allowed
himself to nurse.</p>

<p>But the Senator complains that the freedman is treated
too much as an infant or a pupil. How? Where?
Let him point out the objectionable words. Analyze
the bill. The freedmen, it is admitted, are under the
general superintendence of the Commissioner. But are
we not all under the general superintendence of the
police, to which we may appeal for protection in case
of need? And just such protection the freedmen may
expect from the Commissioner, according to his power.
The Senator himself is under the superintendence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the Presiding Officer of the Senate, whose duty it is to
see that he is protected in his rights on this floor. But
the Presiding Officer can do nothing except according to
law; and the Commissioner is bound by the same inevitable
limitations.</p>

<p>But there are regulations applicable to the contracts
of the freedman. Very well. Why not? To protect
him from the imposition and tyranny of the dominant
race, it is provided that “no freedman shall be employed
on any estate above mentioned otherwise than
according to <em>voluntary contract</em>, reduced to writing, and
certified by the Assistant Commissioner or local superintendent.”
Mark the language,&mdash;“voluntary contract.”
What more can be desired? But this is reduced to
writing. Certainly, as a safeguard to the freedman, and
for his benefit. Then, again, the Assistant Commissioners
are to act “as advisory guardians,” in which capacity
they are to “aid the freedmen in the adjustment of
their wages.” But do not forget that the freedman is
a freeman, and if he does not need such aid or advice,
he may reject it, just as much as the Senator himself.
Look at other clauses, and they will all be found equally
innocent.</p>

<p>But there is the section, originally introduced on
motion of the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Willey</span>],
providing, that, “whenever the Commissioner cannot
otherwise employ any of the freedmen who may
come under his care, he shall, so far as practicable,
make provision for them with humane and suitable persons,
at a just compensation for their services.” Here,
again, are tyranny and outrage carried to the highest
point. But how? The superintendence is that of the
<em>intelligence office</em>, and everything done is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> “in conformity
with law.” This clause, even if it were in any
respect ambiguous, must be ruled by those earlier words
which declare that “every such freedman shall be treated
in all respects as a free man.” What more can be
desired? With this rule as a guide, no freedman can
suffer in rights.</p>

<p>The strange complaint is made, that this measure is
too favorable to the freedman; and, indeed, we have
been told that something is needed for the whites.
Very well; let it be done. I trust that an enlightened
Government will not fail to recognize its duties
to all alike. Meanwhile, it is proposed that abandoned
lands shall be leased to freedmen, and, if they are not
able and disposed to take the lands for a twelvemonth,
then they are to be leased to other persons. Reflect
that the freedmen, for weary generations, have fertilized
these lands with their sweat. The time has come
when they should enjoy the results of their labor, at
least for a few months. This war has grown out of
injustice to them. Plainly, to them we owe the first
fruits of justice. Besides, this provision is essential as
a safeguard against white speculators from a distance,
who will seek to monopolize these lands, with little
or no regard to the freedman. Ay, Sir, it is too evident
that it is essential as a safeguard against grasping
neighbors, who still pant and throb with the bad
passions of Slavery.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the objections are vain. The bill is
not hurtful to the freedman. It is not hostile to Liberty.
Its declared object is the good of the freedman.
Its inspiration is Liberty. Look at it as a whole or in
detail, and you will find the same object and the same
inspiration. It only remains that the Senate should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
adopt it, and give a new assurance of justice to an
oppressed race. In the name of justice, I ask your
votes.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion to postpone was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 13, Nays 16.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 22d, the debate was resumed by Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire,
in opposition to the report, who was followed on the same side
by Mr. Lane, of Indiana, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, and Mr. Reverdy
Johnson, of Maryland. Mr. Conness, of California, spoke in favor of
it. Mr. Sumner, in reply, after answering the criticisms on the bill,
and adducing testimony to its importance, said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have read these opinions merely to bring home to
the Senate, on authoritative grounds, the importance of
providing some protection for this large body of freedmen,
now justly looking to the National Government as
their guardian. That Government has given them the
great boon of Freedom. It is for us to go further, and
see that Freedom is something more than a barren letter.
We must see that it is a fruitful thing, of which
they can avail themselves always, and which will be to
them everywhere prolific of good.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I did not intend to enter into this discussion
this morning. I hoped that a vote might be
taken without further debate. I have no desire to discuss
it. To my mind the question is perfectly clear.
If you reject the pending measure, you voluntarily refuse
to carry forward that great act of Emancipation
which you have already sanctioned. I say, therefore,
for the sake of Emancipation, let the report of this
Committee be adopted; and I appeal to you, Senators,
do not be afraid to be just.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The vote on the report of the Conference Committee stood,&mdash;Yeas
14, Nays 24; so that, though accepted in the House, it was lost in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>Senate. On motion of Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, another Conference
Committee was ordered, consisting of himself, Mr. Harlan, of
Iowa, and Mr. Willey, of West Virginia. The House, on their part, appointed
Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, and Mr.
Rollins, of Missouri. The Committee reported still another bill, placing
the bureau in the War Department.</p>

<p>March 3d, the Senate agreed to the report without a division. In
the House, after an ineffectual effort to lay it on the table, it was agreed
to without a division, and the same day was approved by the President.</p>

<p>June 10th, Mr. Lane, of Kansas, asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to bring in a joint resolution for the recognition of the
Free State Government of the State of Arkansas, which was read,
passed to a second reading, and ordered to be printed.</p>

<p>June 13th, he called it up for consideration, when Mr. Sumner made
the following speech.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I begin by expressing sympathy
with every loyal soul in a Rebel State.
Knowing well, from long experience, the cruel rule and
domination of Slavery, even in this Chamber, I cannot
be indifferent to the trials of loyalty anywhere in these
latter days. Show me a man who in a Rebel State stands
faithful to the national cause, and I go forth to meet
him with heart in hand. To have been true at a time
when truth was disowned is enough for honor as well
as thanks. But the merits of individuals cannot determine
the rights of States.</p>

<p>The case is too important. If individual merits, universally
recognized, could save a State to present rights
in the Union, Tennessee would not now be a self-condemned
exile. There are few anywhere so entirely true
as Andrew Johnson, and not one in all the Rebel States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
who so bravely encountered the Rebellion face to face.
Ten men might have saved Sodom; but he was in himself
more than ten men. Besides, he was a Senator on
this floor, when the State he represented took its place
in the Rebel Confederacy, and joined in war against
the National Government; but he stayed behind with
his country, and kept his seat here. Persons ignorant
of Parliamentary Law have sometimes argued from the
latter circumstance that Rebel Tennessee was still entitled
to her ancient rights in the Union; but they forget
two principles, fixed long ago, beyond all question,
in England, the original home of Parliamentary Law:
first, that the power once conferred by an election to
Parliament is irrevocable, so that it is not affected by
any subsequent change in the constituency; and, secondly,
that a member, when once chosen, is <em>member for
the whole kingdom</em>, becoming thereby, according to the
words of an early author, not merely knight or burgess
of the county or borough which elected him, but knight
or burgess of England.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> If these two principles are not
entirely discarded in our political system, then the seat
of Andrew Johnson was not in any respect affected by
the subsequent madness of his State, nor can the legality
of his seat be any argument for the ancient rights of his
State.</p>

<p>Nor, again, can the fact that Andrew Johnson has
been selected by the Convention of a powerful political
party as candidate for the Vice-Presidency be any argument
for these ancient rights. It is not necessary that
a candidate for President or Vice-President should belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
to a State. It is enough, under the Constitution,
that he is “a natural born citizen.” He may be of the
District of Columbia, or of a Territory, or of a Rebel
State; for these are all equally within the rightful
jurisdiction of the United States, and this is enough.
The national jurisdiction is permanent and indefeasible.</p>

<p>Therefore, I repeat again, we must look beyond the
virtues of individuals. Not all the virtues under heaven
can suffice to make a State of this Union, or establish
any claim for restoration to ancient rights, where
there is failure to comply with essential requirements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question under consideration is of momentous interest.
It concerns primarily the claim to a seat in the
Senate; but it includes also the right of the State of
Arkansas to share at this moment in the National Government
by representation in Congress, and also the
other right of participating in the approaching Presidential
election. And behind this great question looms
that other, “How shall we treat the Rebel States?”
This has already been answered by the House of Representatives
in a bill passed by that body; but it has
not yet been decided by the Senate.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the great question and all the subordinate
questions are presented for decision. Not only
Arkansas, but Louisiana, and every other Rebel State,
will await your judgment. No question of equal importance
has been presented since it was determined to
meet the Rebellion by arms.</p>

<p>For the present I forbear all minute discussion, either
of history or principle. It will be enough, if I state the
case, and exhibit the questions involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>William M. Fishback, a citizen of Arkansas, appears
before the Senate of the United States, and claims
membership. He asserts that he has been duly chosen
to fill the unexpired term of Senator Sebastian, who
was expelled in 1861 for complicity with the Rebellion;
and he produces a certificate purporting to be signed by
the Governor of Arkansas.</p>

<p>Shall this claimant be admitted to a seat in the Senate?
Such is the immediate question. But I have said
that there are other questions, of the highest importance,
which must be considered now and here; for they
all enter into the present case. Admitting the claimant,
we must also admit that other claimant who has
appeared with like credentials as colleague. The question
is not, therefore, Shall Arkansas have one vote in
the Senate? but, Shall it have two?</p>

<p>Then, again, if Arkansas is fully represented in the
Senate, does it not follow that it is to be represented
to the same extent in the other House? If represented
in that Chamber, such representation must be under
the existing Apportionment Act, assigning to Arkansas
two Representatives, chosen by districts, without
reference to the number of votes polled in either.</p>

<p>One privilege draws after it another. To him that
hath shall be given. If Arkansas is admitted to immediate
representation in the National Government,
this Rebel State, which has overthrown the Constitution
within its borders, and assumed the front of war,
can participate in the approaching election of President
and Vice-President by organizing an electoral college,
and, in case the election of either of those great officers
should devolve upon Congress, can give a vote affecting
the result as weighty as that of Massachusetts, New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
York, or Illinois; for, in such case, the vote, which in
the Senate is <i>per capita</i>, is in the House by States.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, I repeat, the decision of the question
before us rules all the questions that can arise upon
the representation of Arkansas in the Congress of the
United States, and also the other question of the participation
of Arkansas in the election of President and
Vice-President for the term of four years next ensuing.
The importance of such a subject cannot be exaggerated.
It is important constitutionally, important practically,
important also to the peace of the country. It
ought to be discussed fully and carefully, especially
when it is considered that we are on the eve of a Presidential
election which may possibly be affected by our
decision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, I am against the admission of Arkansas
to representation in the National Government <em>at
this time and under existing circumstances</em>. There may
be a time, and there may be circumstances, when such
representation will be proper; but clearly at this moment
it is improper, unreasonable, and dangerous. The
reasons are obvious.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The proposed representation is that of a <em>minority</em>,
not only of the people, but even of the ancient
voters of Arkansas. It is superfluous to say that such
representation is inconsistent with republican principles,
and can be vindicated only by overruling necessity.
But this point becomes of peculiar importance, when it
is considered that the minority asking representation
has acquiesced in rebellion, and, still further, that some
of those composing the minority have actively assisted
the public enemy. Look at the facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>The authority and jurisdiction of the United States
were wholly overthrown and subverted in Arkansas.
By action of the State Legislature, and of a Convention
called by this Legislature, followed by a popular vote,
the State was made <i>de facto</i> a member of the Rebel
Confederacy. However much we may deny the rightfulness
or the legality of the proceeding, there is no
question with regard to the fact. This at least is undeniable,
and constitutes an essential ingredient in the
case. As a fact it must be recognized, whatever the
consequences, precisely as truth is recognized. But this
unquestionable fact was followed by a general acquiescence
of the people of Arkansas; so that this State
became in fact, as in name, a Rebel State, linked with
other Rebel States arrayed in arms against the National
Government.</p>

<p>At last, after much bloodshed and various vicissitudes,
through the exertion of the military power of the
United States, a portion of the territory of this State
has been rescued from Rebel domination, and brought
within the lines of our army. The rest will follow, in
process of time, and after further bloodshed, until eventually
the whole State will be rescued from Rebel
domination, and brought within the lines of our army.
Even then we shall be obliged to wait for tokens of returning
loyalty also. But at the present moment the
possession of the State is still contested by opposing
forces, and a minority only has signified adhesion or re-adhesion
to the National Government. This objection,
of course, may be removed by time; but it existed in
full force at the election of the claimant, and is decisive
upon the question before us.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, it is according to the genius of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Government that the <em>majority</em> should rule. A majority
is the natural base of a republic. To found a republic
on a minority is scarcely less impracticable than to
stand a pyramid on its apex.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The proposed representation of Arkansas in
the Senate is unjust and inequitable in relation to the
representation of the loyal States; and if extended to
representation in the House of Representatives and in
the Electoral Colleges, it becomes still more unjust and
inequitable. By the original terms of union, the other
States have agreed that <em>the whole people</em> of Arkansas
shall have two Senators, and Representatives according
to a fixed proportion,&mdash;and also electoral votes for President
and Vice-President according to the number of
Senators and Representatives. Now it would be manifestly
wrong toward all the loyal States, if not a fraud
upon their rights, to assign such representation and
such privilege to a <em>fraction</em> of the people of Arkansas,
constituting a small minority, so that, on all questions
of legislation, of treaties, or of appointments, in the
discharge of legislative, diplomatic, and executive trusts,
this small minority would wield in the Senate all the
power of a loyal State, while in the choice of President
and Vice-President it might turn the scale.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The military occupation of Arkansas, and
the unsettled condition of the community there, cannot
be forgotten, when we are considering whether to admit
the representatives of a newly organized <em>civil government</em>
in that State. Military occupation is practically
inconsistent with civil government. Even if the former
does not absolutely exclude the latter, yet it is evident
that it must exercise a controlling influence. It is impossible
in time of war to preserve the conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
peace,&mdash;especially in time of civil war. Military power,
when engaged in subduing rebellion, cannot be insensible
to political forces. It must win what it cannot
overcome. From the nature of the case, ordinary political
conditions are disturbed or subverted, and electoral
power loses its essential character, so as to be no longer
entitled to that peculiar respect which it enjoys under
American institutions. These observations I apply solely
to a theatre of war; and I insist, that, so applied, they
are true, just, and indisputable.</p>

<p>But, in point of fact, there is another and kindred
force, which conspires with the former to disturb suffrage
in Arkansas: I mean that proceeding from incursions
and hostile operations of the enemy. These prevent
elections in some parts of the State, and render
them partial in others; and this unhappy condition
must continue so long as war prevails there. That I do
not exaggerate these perils, let me quote the testimony
of General Gantt, a citizen of Arkansas, who participated
in the recent election. “Thousands,” says he,
“when they started to the polls in the morning, felt that
at nightfall, when they returned, it might be to a mass
of charred and smoking ruins and to a beggared and impoverished
family; and yet other thousands knew that
the knife of the murderous crew of Shelby, Marmaduke,
and others was whetted for their throats, and might do
their execution before the polls were reached; and all
knew, that, should the tide of war surge backward over
our State, instead of being simply ordered out of the
lines, bankruptcy, dungeons, chains, and an ignominious
death awaited them.” This picture, which is unquestionably
authentic, while it interests us for the heroic
sufferers, testifies conclusively how incapable Arkansas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
is at this moment to bear the burdens and discharge the
trusts of a State.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> The present organization in Arkansas, seeking
representation on this floor, is without that <em>legality
of origin</em> required by the American system of government.
It is revolutionary in character. Nay, more, it
may all be traced to <em>a military order</em>. Clearly, this incongruity
will not be tolerated. <em>A new civil government</em>,
to be recognized as a State of this Union, <em>cannot be born
of military power</em>. Congress has jurisdiction over all
those States in which loyal governments have been
overturned; and this jurisdiction furnishes a natural,
obvious, and constitutional origin for the new government.
Without it, I am at a loss to see how <em>the connecting
link of legality</em> can be preserved between the
old and the new. This is not the first time in our national
history that Congress has stood between the old
and the new. Such is its natural place and function.
At the separation of the Colonies from the mother country,
it interfered by formal resolution to indicate the
process by which the new governments should be constituted,
although the Tories of that day doubted the
power. According to this example, sustained by congenial
principles, Congress must now set the new government
in motion, and infuse into it the vital force
found in liberty regulated by law.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i> Arkansas is at this moment shut out from
<em>commercial intercourse</em> with the loyal States, under the
Proclamation of the President of 16th August, 1861, in
pursuance of the Act of Congress of 13th July, 1861.
By this Proclamation it is placed on the list of States
declared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> “insurrection against the United States;
and all commercial intercourse between the same and
the inhabitants thereof and the citizens of other States
and other parts of the United States is unlawful, and
will remain unlawful until such insurrection shall cease
or has been suppressed”; and all goods, chattels, wares,
and merchandise, coming from any of the enumerated
States and proceeding to any other State by land or
water, are made liable to forfeiture.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> And yet Arkansas,
while still under the ban of a Presidential proclamation
and a Congressional statute establishing non-intercourse
with other States, asks representation in the
National Government. Disqualified for trade with other
States, it asks to govern them. The old practice is
to be reversed. Thus far in history trade has preceded
political power; now political power is to precede
trade. Arkansas cannot send her merchants into the
loyal States to buy and sell. Can she send representatives
into this Chamber to vote? Can she send electors
into the Electoral College to choose a President?</p>

<p>Such, Mr. President, are five distinct reasons, obvious
to the most superficial observer, against recognizing
any representation from Arkansas at this time:
first, because the representation is founded on a minority;
secondly, because any such representation, unjust
in itself, is especially unjust toward the loyal States;
thirdly, because the military occupation of Arkansas,
and its exposed condition, are inconsistent with civil
government; fourthly, because the present organization
of Arkansas is without that legality of origin required
by American institutions; and, fifthly, because it is absurd
to admit a State to representation which is still,
by solemn proclamation, shut out from commercial intercourse
with the loyal States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>The argument thus far applies to the present case,
without touching that other question, sometimes discussed,
whether, in point of fact, Arkansas is still a
State of the Union. Evidently, Arkansas may have
preserved her place in the Union, and yet not be entitled
at this moment to representation. She may be
a State, but in a condition of political syncope or suspended
animation. Or she may be under such abnormal
influences as to render her, for the time being, incompetent
to perform the functions of a State.</p>

<p>But if Arkansas, by reason of her Ordinance of Secession,
and open participation in the war against us,
has lost a place in the Union, it is manifest that the
Senate cannot now admit the claimant to a seat as one
of its members; nor can it admit him at all, until Congress,
by joint vote, has restored the State to its original
position. The power to admit States into this Union,
and, by consequence, the power to <em>readmit</em> them, are
vested in Congress, to be exerted by joint resolution or
act, with the concurrence of both Chambers and the
approval of the President. Here I content myself with
a statement. For the present I waive all consideration
of the <em>status</em> of the seceded States. The argument is
complete without it.</p>

<p>It is my desire to present this case on the facts, and
not on any theory or hypothesis. I say nothing, therefore,
on the question, what constitutes a State government
in this Union; whether a State, by a process of
suicide, may not cease to exist; whether a State may
not by forfeiture lose its rights as a State; or whether,
when the loyal government is overthrown, a State does
not lapse into the condition of a Territory under Congressional
jurisdiction, to be treated like other national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
territory. All these questions I put aside. I choose
to present the case of Arkansas on facts which nobody
can question.</p>

<p>It is enough that the loyal authorities were overthrown,
and there were no functionaries holding office
under the State government bound by oath to support
the Constitution of the United States; and since
a State government is necessarily composed of such
functionaries thus bound by oath, there was no State
government we could recognize. Sir, does any Senator
recognize the Rebel governor of Arkansas? Does
any Senator recognize the Rebel functionaries who held
the offices of the State? Of course not. It follows,
then, that the offices were empty. And this was the
practical conclusion of Andrew Johnson, when he began
to reorganize Tennessee, in an address as early as
18th March, 1862. Here are his words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I find most, if not all, of the offices, both State and
Federal, <em>vacated</em>, either by actual abandonment or by the
action of the incumbents, in attempting to subordinate their
functions to a power in hostility to the fundamental law of

<p>If the offices were vacated, the machine of government
could not work. And now the practical question
is, how this machine shall be again put in motion. Obviously,
not by any power within, but by some power
without.</p>

<p>It may be said that the new State organization is
authorized by the President’s proclamation of amnesty,
and that the claimant’s case stands good according to
the promises of this exceptional paper. A glance is
enough to dispel this pretension. True it is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
President put forward a plan for reorganizing loyal
State governments in the Rebel territory, and he proffered
a guaranty to these communities against domestic
violence and Rebel invasion; but he neither proposed
nor promised any representation in Congress or in the
Electoral College. Nor would such a proposition or
promise by him have possessed the slightest validity;
because, by the Constitution, “each House is to be the
judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its
own members.” This provision is inconsistent with any
prerogative of the President over this question, even if
such prerogative were not controlled by that other provision
which reserves to Congress the power to admit
new States into the Union.</p>

<p>The Proclamation declared, that, whenever, in any of
the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina,
and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than
one tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at
the Presidential election of 1860, each having taken the
particular oath prescribed by the Proclamation, and not
having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by
the election law of the State existing immediately before
its secession, and excluding all others, should <em>reëstablish</em>
a State government which should be republican, and in
no wise contravening the Proclamation oath, it should
be recognized as the true government of the State, which
should receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional
provision that “the United States shall guaranty
to every State in this Union a republican form
of government.” Subsequently, in the same paper, the
President declares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> “that whether members sent to Congress
from any State shall be admitted to seats constitutionally
rests exclusively with the respective Houses,
and not to any extent with the Executive.” Nothing is
said on the participation of such reorganized State in
the approaching Presidential election; and the question
seems left open for the judgment of Congress, to which
it obviously belongs, to be settled by joint action.</p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that the reorganization contemplated
by the President was in nature provisional. It
was not complete or permanent, but evidently looked
to the action of the legislative power to determine
representation, whether in Congress or in the Electoral
College. Loyal governments might be established in
the manner indicated for the conservation of local order,
and these would be recognized and upheld provisionally
by the military power. Considered from this point
of view, and in the absence of Congressional action, the
President’s plan of reconstruction was, to a certain extent,
proper, if not necessary, and very little obnoxious
to objections sometimes brought against it. A handful
of persons keeping their loyalty might justly look to
the military power for support against a hostile majority.
Such a handful might be allowed to set up a local
government for the management of local affairs, and to
assist the National Government in the work of restoration.
All this is natural. But the limitation is clear.
Admitting it right to authorize the establishment of a
local government for the benefit of a handful of loyal
persons in a Rebel State, it does not by any means follow
that such local government can be entitled to representation
in the National Government as a loyal unit,
on an equality with the loyal States of the Union. The
two questions are entirely different, and the latter was
wisely left untouched by the Proclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, the power of the President to institute this
government is only as commander-in-chief of the army.
It is therefore military in character. But what proceeds
out of this power is, from the nature of the case, <em>provisional
or temporary, until it has received the sanction
of Congress</em>. To a certain extent, and from the necessity
of the hour, military governments may be constituted
by the President; but permanent civil governments,
with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Collamer.</span> To last beyond the war.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> As the Senator from Vermont well
suggests, “to last beyond the war,” with right of representation
in Congress and in the Electoral College, cannot
be constituted by the President. Such a power
would be open to infinite abuse, and in the hands of
an ambitious President might be employed for selfish
purposes. The national safety, in harmony with republican
principles, requires that it should be exercised
by Congress, which must take the lead in calling
the new government into being.</p>

<p>Against these conclusions there can be no argument
founded on principle. But it may be said that the admission
of Senators from Virginia constitutes a precedent.
This is a mistake. The Virginia case is a precedent
for nothing, unless it be to make us more careful
for the future. It arose at the beginning of the
troubles, before the relations of the Rebel States had
become fixed by pertinacious war, and was little considered
at the time. But, beyond all, it had this peculiarity,&mdash;that
a large section, geographically, of Virginia,
had, in fact, declined to recognize the pretension of secession,
and promptly constituted a loyal government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
without military intervention, so that practically it had
never been part of the Rebel Government. The circumstances
were so exceptional, that this case cannot be
cited to determine our conduct toward a State which in
all its parts, throughout its whole jurisdiction, accepted
the pretension of secession, and maintained it by arms.
Such a State is, beyond all question, a Rebel State,
with no title to a place in Congress or in the Electoral
College, until readmitted to its ancient rights by
a vote in both Houses of Congress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The readmission of a Rebel State to representation
is not less important than its original admission into
the Union. And when it is considered that what is
done for one such State will be a precedent for all, its
importance is multiplied by the number of Rebel States;
and this again is augmented infinitely by the disturbed
condition of affairs, and the supreme duty to take every
precaution for the restoration of permanent tranquillity.
It is not enough, if we comply with certain forms, or
constitute a State in name only. Much more must be
done, and all this must be placed under fixed and irreversible
guaranties. Vain is victory on the battle-field,
if these guaranties are not obtained. To make these
possible, our armies are now engaged in the deadly
shock. That the future at least may be secure, the
present is given over to blood and slaughter, to graves
and epitaphs. And here is the difference between your
responsibilities and those of the soldier. The latter sees
only the present; but you must see the future also.
The soldier meets the enemy face to face; the statesman,
by wise precautions, provides that the enemy, once
conquered, shall never rise again. Vain is the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the soldier, if not consummated and crowned by the
wisdom of the statesman.</p>

<p>For years Slavery has been claiming guaranties in
States and Territories, and these chambers have echoed
to the hoarse, inhuman cry. At last another voice begins
to prevail, ascending from basement to cupola,
filling chamber and dome with diviner echo: it is the
voice of Freedom claiming guaranties. In the absence
of any constitutional prohibition of Slavery, it is evident
that these guaranties can be obtained only under
sanction of Congress in its legislative capacity. And
here we are brought again to the question of representation;
for as it is clear that representation cannot
be conceded, until the guaranties for Freedom have
been secured, so it follows, representation can be obtained
only under the sanction of Congress in its legislative
capacity.</p>

<p>That Congress in its legislative capacity must determine
this question is sustained by the necessity of the
case, by reason, by authority, and by the President’s
Proclamation.</p>

<p>1. I have already shown that guaranties for Freedom
are <em>a condition precedent</em> to representation; so that,
by the necessity of the case, the latter must be determined
by the joint action of both Houses of Congress.
Such is one form in which this necessity appears. But
there is another.</p>

<p>Congress must have jurisdiction over every portion of
the United States <em>where there is no other government</em>;
but there can be no other government in the Rebel
States; so that the words of Chief Justice Marshall are
as applicable to a State without a loyal State government
as they were originally to a Territory:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Perhaps the power of governing a Territory belonging
to the United States, which has not by becoming a State
acquired <em>the means of self-government</em>, may result necessarily
from the facts that <em>it is not within the jurisdiction of any
particular State</em>, <span class="smcap">and is within the power and jurisdiction
of the United States</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The three things here affirmed of a Territory may all
be affirmed of a Rebel State.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> It has not the means of self-government.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> It is not within the jurisdiction of any
particular State.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> It is within the power and jurisdiction of
the United States.</p>

<p>From these again ensues the necessity of Congressional
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>2. It would be unreasonable, if not absurd, for each
Chamber to determine the question of representation
for itself. Suppose, for instance, the Senate admit
claimants from Arkansas, and the House reject them.
Then we should witness the anomaly of a State admitted
to one Chamber and excluded from the other. This
would be <em>semi-admission</em> into the Union. Part would
be <em>in</em>, and part <em>out</em>. The Senators and Representatives
of the same State would be compelled to separate, as,
in Grecian mythology, one of the memorable twins,
Castor and Pollux, was translated to Olympus, and the
other was left upon earth. The Constitution does not
contemplate the repetition of any such fable. Arkansas
must stay away, until she can be received in <em>both</em>
Houses, and be recognized as a unit, not as a fraction;
but no power short of Congress can assure this equal
reception in both Houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Authority is in harmony with reason. The question
seems to have been anticipated by the opinion of
the Supreme Court of the United States, as pronounced
by Chief Justice Taney in the case of <i>Luther</i> v. <i>Borden</i>.
Here are the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution
of the United States provides that the United States
shall guaranty to every State in the Union a republican
form of government, and shall protect each of them against
invasion, and, on the application of the Legislature, or of
the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened),
against domestic violence.</p>

<p>“Under this article of the Constitution, it rests with Congress
to decide what government is the established one in
a State. For, as the United States guaranty to each State
a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide
what government is established in the State, before it can
determine whether it is republican or not. And when the
Senators and Representatives of a State are admitted into
the councils of the Union, the authority of the government
under which they are appointed, as well as its republican
character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority.
And its decision is binding on every other department
of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial
tribunal.”<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to these positive words, “it rests with Congress
to decide what government is the established one
in a State.” But Congress can decide only through joint
action.</p>

<p>4. The Constitution, also, by positive text, seems to
place the question beyond doubt. There are express
words, as we have already seen, declaring that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> “the
United States shall guaranty to every State in the
Union a republican form of government.” If these
words stood alone, the case would be clear; but it becomes
clearer still, when we revert to the other clause,
by which it is provided that “the Congress shall have
power to make all laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution all powers vested
by this Constitution in the Government of the United
States.” Now, since the guaranty is vested in the Government
of the United States, it follows that Congress
has the power for carrying it into execution. In Arkansas
a republican government has been overthrown
by rebellion. Congress must see that such government
is restored; and to this end it has all needful power.
Congress, and not the President, must decide when the
restoration has taken place.</p>

<p>5. There is also the President’s Proclamation, which,
by its very terms, necessarily implies the action of
Congress. We have, first, the positive declaration that
“whether members sent to Congress from any State
shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively
with the respective Houses, and not to any extent
with the Executive.” But the language of the
Proclamation and of the accompanying message plainly
assumes that the Rebel States have lost their original
character as States of the Union. Thus in one place
the President says that “the loyal State governments
of several States have for a long time been <em>subverted</em>.”
But if subverted, they no longer exist. In another place
he proposes to “<em>reinaugurate</em> loyal State governments.”
But a proposition to <em>reinaugurate</em> implies a new start.
In another place he proposes to “<em>reëstablish</em> a State
government which shall be republican.” But we do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
not <em>reëstablish</em> a government continuing to exist. In
another place he proposes to “<em>set up</em>” a State government
in the mode prescribed. But whatever requires
to be set up is evidently down. In another place he
considers how to guaranty and protect “a <em>revived</em> State
government.” But we revive only what is dead, or, at
least, faint. There is still another place, where the President
evidently looks to the possibility of a change of
name, boundary, subdivisions, constitution, and general
code of laws in the restored State. These are his identical
words: “And it is suggested <em>as not improper</em>, that,
in <em>constructing</em> a loyal State government in any State,
<em>the name of the State</em>, <em>the boundary</em>, the subdivisions,
the constitution, and the general code of laws, as before
the Rebellion, be maintained.” Thus the President
does not insist that even the name and boundary
of a State shall be preserved. He contents himself
with suggesting that it will not be “improper” to preserve
them “in <em>constructing</em> a loyal State government.”
Of course this suggestion of what is not improper implies
necessarily that in his opinion even these great
changes are within the discretion of the revived community.</p>

<p>I have called especial attention to the language of
the President, because it constantly assumes, in a succession
of phrases, that the Rebel States are in an abnormal
condition, from which they are to be recovered
or revived; and since such recovery or revival can be
consummated only by action of Congress, it is reasonable
to infer that such was his expectation. At all
events, the Proclamation, by repeated assumptions with
regard to the Rebel States, testifies to the necessity of
Congressional action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already seen that Andrew Johnson declared
the State of Tennessee “vacated” of all local government
which we are bound to respect; and this language
obviously harmonizes with that of the President.
But Arkansas was in a similar situation.</p>

<p>Such are some of the arguments for the power of
Congress. Others might be adduced; but I have said
enough. The necessity of the case, reason, the authority
of the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and
the President’s Proclamation, each and all, tend to the
same conclusion, even without resorting to those war
powers which are all within the reach of Congress. Yet
if we glance at the latter, we find the power of Congress
declared beyond question. There is nothing the
President may do as commander-in-chief which Congress
may not direct and govern, according to the authoritative
words of Chancellor Kent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though the Constitution vests the executive power in
the President, and declares him to be commander-in-chief
of the army and navy of the United States, <em>these powers
must necessarily be subordinate to the legislative power in Congress</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And these powers, vast as they are, when called into
activity by the exigency of war or rebellion, become
as constitutional as if specified precisely in a written
text.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, there is a saying of Antiquity applicable
to this question: <em>Make haste slowly</em>. Do not fail
to make haste; but let your haste be governed by wisdom
and prudence. In making haste, do not sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
all safeguards for the future. In haste to welcome Senators
from Rebel States, do not forget everything else:
do not forget the principles of republican institutions,
offended by the rule of a minority; do not forget the
principles of justice among the States, shocked by admission
of the fraction of a Rebel State to equality of
power with loyal States; do not forget the disturbed
condition of the Rebel States, rendering the civil authorities
subordinate to the military; do not forget the
necessity of a connecting link of legality between the
old and the new; do not forget that commercial intercourse
must be restored, and every ban of proclamation
or statute removed, before representation can
be allowed; and, still further, do not forget that the
Rebel States, by their own acts, sustained by bloody
war, have voluntarily placed themselves outside the
pale of political association, until Congress shall recognize
them again entitled to their original equality;
but, above all, do not forget that there can be no recognition
of a Rebel State, until its permanent tranquillity
is assured by irreversible guaranties which no
local power can disturb. Keep these things in mind,
and then make haste.</p>

<p>Of course, when within the confines of a State the
Rebellion is triumphantly subdued, and the great
body of the people manifest an unmistakable loyalty,&mdash;when
local elections are held according to ordinary
municipal forms,&mdash;when laws, and not arms, prevail,&mdash;and
when a government, republican in fact as in
name, making Slavery forever impossible, under any
form or pretence, is permanently established,&mdash;then
will Congress, by proper legislative action, rejoice to
welcome the newly constituted State to its equal share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
in the National Government. But such welcome must
not be precipitate. It can be offered only after most
careful inquiry into the actual condition of things,
and the assured conviction that the Rebel State has
been newly constituted in fact as in name. And this
caution is needed, not only for the good of the Union,
but for the good of the State itself, which must
be saved from premature responsibilities beyond the
measure of its present powers.</p>

<p>Sir, it is much to be a State in full fellowship and
equality with other States represented in these two
Chambers, with a voice in the election of President
and Vice-President, and with a star on the national
flag. To be admitted into such prerogatives and privileges,
a State must be “above suspicion,” and it
must be able to use well all the great powers belonging
to the State. But if a State is not yet “above
suspicion,” and is not strong enough to stand alone,
even against domestic disturbers, it cannot expect immediate
recognition. It must wait yet a little longer,
until, restored at last in character and in strength, it
can do all the duties of a State, and with master-hand
grasp that Ulyssean bow which pretenders strive in
vain to bend.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I conclude as I began, with my
heart’s gratitude to those brave citizens who again in
Arkansas lift the national banner. Let them not be
disheartened. Their country is with them in all their
perils and all their efforts, longing to receive them
again into ancient fellowship and equality; but the
time for this welcome has not yet come. Meanwhile
let them remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> “they also serve who only
stand and wait.”</p>

<p>June 17th, on the Tariff, the question arose of repealing the clause
exempting from tax “philosophical apparatus and instruments imported
for the use of any society incorporated for philosophical, literary, or
religious purposes, or for the encouragement of the fine arts, or for the
use or by the order of any college, academy, school, or seminary of

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Little money, much mischief: these are two objects
that present themselves. That we shall obtain
little money is obvious, when it is considered that
the philosophical apparatus and instruments imported
by colleges and literary institutions, particularly when
exposed to this tax, will be of little value. Twenty per
cent on their value will not be much for the country.
The detriment will appear in the discouragement to
their importation. Now, Sir, I would encourage such
importations. I would encourage everything by which
these associations may be benefited. Not only the associations
will gain by such encouragement, but the
whole land will reap the advantage. If I could have
my way, I would rather lavish upon them bounties.
To my mind it is clear that the education of our country
would be advanced by stimulating such importations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
rather than by discouraging them. But there is

say that to my mind the proposition is not creditable
to our country, and, I think, if adopted, will be mischievous.
That is the way it impresses me. I cannot
see it otherwise. It is to me a tax on education, and
as such odious to an extent which I am hardly willing
to characterize. Because we are engaged in war, I find
no reason for a tax on education. Tax luxuries, tax
necessaries, tax everything else; but do not tax education.

<div class="medium">

<p>May 2, 1862, Mr. Sumner gave notice that he should, at an early
day, ask leave to introduce a bill to abolish the coastwise traffic in slaves
under the flag of the United States; and he added, “In giving this
notice, I desire to say that there is a disgraceful statute which exists
unrepealed, and my object is to remove it from the statute-book.”</p>

<p>March 22, 1864, he reported from the Committee on Slavery and
Freedmen a bill to prohibit commerce in slaves among the several
States, and the holding or transporting of human beings as property
in any vessel within the jurisdiction of the National Government,
which was read and passed to a second reading. At the same time he
said that he did this as a report in part on “a large number of petitions
calling upon Congress to provide by legislation for the extinction
of Slavery.”</p>

<p>The bill reported was as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“A Bill to prohibit commerce in slaves among the several States, and the
holding or transportation of human beings as property in any vessel within
the jurisdiction of the National Government.</p>

<p>“<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That there shall be no commerce
in slaves among the several States, by land or by water; and any person
attempting or aiding to transport slaves, as an article of commerce, from
one State to another State, or any person who shall take part in such commerce,
either as seller, buyer, or agent, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and, being convicted thereof before any court having competent
jurisdiction, shall suffer imprisonment for not more than five years, and be
fined not exceeding five thousand dollars, one half of such fine to go to the
informer; and every slave so treated as an article of commerce among States
shall be free.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That no human being shall be held or
transported as property in any vessel on the high seas, or sailing coastwise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>or on any navigable waters within the jurisdiction of the United States;
and every vessel violating the provisions of this act shall be forfeited to the
United States; and every master of such vessel consenting to such violation
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof subject
to the penalties hereinbefore provided, one half of the fine to go to the informer;
and every human being so held or transported as property shall be
free.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That all acts or parts of acts inconsistent
herewith, including especially so much of an act approved March
second, one thousand eight hundred and seven, as regulates the coastwise
slave-trade, are hereby repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Failing to obtain an opportunity for this bill in the Senate, Mr. Sumner
determined to move it on an appropriation bill.</p>

<p>June 24th, the Senate having under consideration the bill making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government, Mr. Sumner
moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That sections eight and nine of the Act entitled
‘An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within
the jurisdiction of the United States from and after the first day of January,
in the year of our Lord 1808,’ which sections undertake to regulate the
coastwise slave-trade, are hereby repealed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sherman, who had succeeded Mr. Fessenden as Chairman of the
Finance Committee, “would not oppose the amendment on an ordinary
bill,” but he trusted “the Senate would keep this bill free from these
disputed, extraneous, political questions.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am sorry that the Senator
objects to this amendment. It is true, his objection
is of form; but I venture to say that no such
objection should be made to such a proposition, especially
at this stage of the session.</p>

<p>In moving it now on an appropriation bill, I follow
approved precedents. There is no rule of order against
it; nor is there any rule of usage. On the contrary, it
is in conformity with both order and usage.</p>

<p>The Senator wishes to keep the Appropriation Bill
free from extraneous matter. But this is not sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
reason for excluding my amendment, unless the Senator
is ready, for the sake of form, to sacrifice substance. If
it be important that my amendment should prevail, and
if at this late stage of the session it may be difficult to
carry it otherwise, then am I clearly right in moving it,
as I now do, and the Senator is wrong in opposing it.
An appropriation bill is like a “through train,” and
while its special office is to appropriate money, yet it
may carry anything required by the public good.</p>

<p>Why, Sir, there is hardly ever an appropriation bill
that is not compelled to take passengers in this way. It
has been so during the present session repeatedly; and
if the Senator will read the “Statutes at Large,” he will
find that the usage has prevailed for years. It is no
new thing. I do not begin it.</p>

<p>If it were necessary to furnish examples, I might
point to my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>], who gained one of his proudest triumphs in
this Chamber, securing to him the sympathy and gratitude
especially of sailors, by moving on an appropriation
bill the abolition of the lash in the naval and commercial
marine of the United States. Had he been
driven to wait a special act for this purpose, I fear
he would have been waiting to this day. And the example
of the Senator has been followed by the Senator
from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>], who, on an appropriation
bill, moved and carried the abolition of grog in
the navy.</p>

<p>But I am not without personal experience under this
head. I trust that I shall not take too great a liberty,
if I adduce it even in detail. I was chosen to the Senate
for the first time immediately after the passage of
the infamous Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. If I received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
from the people of Massachusetts any special
charge, it was to use my best endeavors to secure the
repeal of that act. I began the work in the first session
that I was here. Disappointed in various efforts to
bring the question directly before the Senate on a bill
or resolution, I ventured at last&mdash;on the advice of eminent
Senators who differed from me in sentiment, but
who appreciated candidly the obligations of my position&mdash;to
move the repeal on an appropriation bill. A
debate ensued, which lasted till late in the evening.
It may not be uninteresting to know that on the ayes
and noes there were but four votes in the affirmative,&mdash;Mr.
Chase, Mr. Hale, Mr. Sumner, and Mr. Wade. This
was 26th August, 1852. Such was the weakness of our
cause at that time.</p>

<p>But please remark, that, throughout the protracted
and sometimes acrimonious debate, it was never for a
moment objected that the proposition was “not germane
to the bill,” or that it was not completely in order.
Had any such thing been tenable, had there been
the least apology for it, had it not been utterly unreasonable,
be assured, Sir, it would have been made the
excuse for stifling the discussion. The two political
parties had just made their nomination for President.
Franklin Pierce was the candidate of the Democrats,
and Winfield Scott of the Whigs. Both had united
on platforms declaring the Compromise measures, including
the Fugitive Slave Act, “a finality” not to be
opened or discussed. But they were opened and discussed
on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, was at the time Chairman
of the Committee on Finance. He was in many respects
a remarkable person, with a mind enlarged somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
by study and long experience in public affairs, and
with a temper not easily disturbed. Looking back upon
his conduct of the business entrusted to him, there can
be no question of his ability or fidelity. There was neither
weakness nor indifference in that mildness of sway.
He understood completely the duties of his position, was
a jealous guardian of the appropriation bills, and was,
moreover, a most determined thick-and-thin partisan of
Slavery in all its pretensions. But I do not recollect
that he interposed any objection to the time or place
of my motion; and though the Fugitive Slave Bill was
part of his political and social creed, I am sure that he
allowed the debate to close without any criticism upon
my course, or a single impatient word. All this now
belongs to history, and I mention it as a precedent for
the present hour.</p>

<p>My motion that day was discussed on its merits,
and I trust my motion to-day will be discussed in the
same way.</p>

<p>I seek to remove from the statute-book odious provisions
in support of Slavery. Whoever is in favor of
those provisions, whoever is disposed to keep alive the
coastwise slave-trade, or to recognize it in our statutes,
will naturally vote against my motion. And yet let
me say that I am at a loss to understand how, at this
moment, at this stage of our history, any Senator can
hesitate to unite with me in this work of expurgation
and purification. At all events, I trust the Senator
from Ohio will not set up an objection of form to prevent
the success of this good work. He must not be
more severe against Freedom now than was the representative
of Slavery who occupied his place when
I moved the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson agreed with Mr. Sherman in his objection,
and then argued, that, on the repeal of the Act of Congress regulating
this trade, it could be carried on under the Constitution without
restriction.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Of course I disagree radically with the Senator from
Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>]. He is always willing to interpret
the Constitution for Slavery. I interpret it for
Freedom. And yet he is anxious lest the repeal of the
two obnoxious sections regulating the coastwise slave-trade
should leave it open to unrestrained practice. I
do not share his anxiety.</p>

<p>Where will the slaves come from? Not from the
Rebel States; for Emancipation is the destined law
there. Not from his own State; for Emancipation will
soon be the law there. But even should slaves be found
for this traffic (which, thank God, cannot be the case), I
am unwilling that Congress should continue to regulate
the ignoble business. Our statute-book should not
be defiled by any such license. Remove this license,
and the Constitution, rightly interpreted, will do the
rest.</p>

<p>Here arises the difference between the Senator and
myself. He proceeds as if those old days still prevailed,
when Slavery was installed supreme over the
Supreme Court, giving immunity to Slavery everywhere.
The times have changed, and the Supreme Court will
yet testify to the change. To me it seems clear, that,
under the Constitution, no person can be held as a slave
on shipboard within the national jurisdiction, and that
the national flag cannot cover a slave. The Senator
thinks differently, and relies upon the Supreme Court;
but I cannot doubt that this regenerated tribunal will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
yet speak for Freedom as in times past it has spoken
for Slavery. And I trust, should my life be spared, to
see the Senator from Maryland, who bows always to
the decisions of that tribunal, recognize gladly the law
of Freedom thus authoritatively pronounced. Perhaps
he will wonder that he was ever able to interpret the
Constitution for Slavery. If he should not, others
must.</p>

<p>But my special purpose is to remove odious provisions,
and I have contented myself with words of repeal,
in the hope of presenting the proposition in such
a form as to unite the largest number of votes. My
own disposition has been to go further, and to add words
of positive prohibition. But, at the present moment, I
am willing to waive this addition, and content myself
with the simple repeal, that our statute-book may no
longer be degraded, trusting that the Constitution, rightly
interpreted, will suffice. And yet the positive prohibition,
which the Senator seems to invite or to challenge,
would not only purify the statute-book, but effectually
guard against the future, so that both Constitution
and Law would be arrayed against an infamous traffic.
Clearly this ought to be done; and if I have not presented
it, do not set it down to indifference or inattention,
but simply to my desire that the proposition,
moved on an appropriation bill, should be limited to
the necessity of the occasion. To do less than I propose
would be wrong. I should be glad to do more.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am surprised that any Senator should oppose the proposition of the
Senator from Massachusetts, for we all know that eventually it will be
adopted. The objection as to its materiality, or proper connection with this
measure, is but an objection of time. No gentleman can question that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>Senator from Massachusetts will eventually carry his proposition.… Why,
then, contest the matter longer?… It may as well come now as at any
time.… Sir, I regret to see this. Every law put upon the statute-book
by our fathers, with a view of carrying out the provisions of the Constitution,
or in pursuance of the spirit of the union between the States, I regret
to see wiped out; but we have witnessed it, and I think the effort to
delay is useless.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Collamer, of Vermont, argued for the repeal, insisting that “all
laws that undertake to deal with slaves, who are persons under the
Constitution and our laws, as articles of merchandise, are unconstitutional.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Sumner added to his amendment the words, “and
the coastwise slave-trade is prohibited forever”; so that the amendment
repealed the two obnoxious sections regulating the trade, and
also prohibited it.</p>

<p>June 25th, the debate continuing, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p>I wish to make one remark on the question of power.
I say nothing on the point whether Congress under the
Constitution may regulate the trade in slaves between
the States on the land. I waive that question. The
proposition before the Senate simply undertakes to prohibit
the coastwise slave-trade. Now, Sir, I hold in my
hand Brightly’s Digest. Turning to that, you will find
one head entitled “Coasting Trade,” containing no less
than forty-eight different sections, each in the nature of
a regulation by Congress on that subject. I turn next
to another head, entitled “Passengers.” There I find
seventeen sections, each in the nature of a regulation on
that subject; and in point of fact it is well known that
Congress has, by most minute regulations, determined
the conditions on which passengers shall be carried in
ships. It is known that those regulations are applied
especially on board the California steamers, and the
steamers between this country and Europe. In the
one case the steamers are foreign; in the other they are
domestic,&mdash;or the trade, if I may so say, is domestic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
In view of this minute and ample legislation on the
subject of passengers and of the coasting-trade, I submit
there can be no question that Congress can go
further, and, by a final regulation, declare that in our
coasting-trade there shall be no such thing as the slave-trade.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was lost,&mdash;Yeas 13, Nays 20.</p>

<p>At the next stage of the bill Mr. Sumner moved the same amendment,
with the words prohibiting the coastwise slave-trade. On moving
it, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have but one observation to make. It seems to me
this Congress will do wrong to itself, wrong to the country,
wrong to history, wrong to the national cause, if
it separates without clearing the statute-book of every
support of Slavery. Now this is the last support in
the statute-book, and I entreat the Senate to remove
it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Saulsbury moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, which
was lost without a division. Meanwhile Mr. Sumner had succeeded
in attaching to the Appropriation Bill the clause opening United
States courts to colored witnesses. Alluding to this incident, Mr.
Doolittle said that he did not like to vote for such measures on appropriation
bills, but that he was in favor of the abolition of the coastwise
slave-trade, and should vote in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The amendment was carried,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 14,&mdash;and the bill
was approved by the President July 2, 1864.</p>

<p>Failing to obtain a hearing for the bill reported from the Committee
on Slavery and Freedmen,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Mr. Sumner resorted again to the Appropriation
Bill.</p>

<p>June 25th, the Senate having under consideration the Civil Appropriation
Bill, Mr. Sumner, after stating that the third section appropriated
one hundred thousand dollars to aid the administration of justice,
especially in bringing to conviction counterfeiters of Treasury notes,
bonds, or other United States securities, as well as coin, remarked, that,
to accomplish this result, something more than money was needed,&mdash;that
there must be an amendment of the Law of Evidence; and he sent
to the Chair the following proviso, to be added to the third section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That in the courts of the United States there shall be no exclusion
of any witness on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This, Mr. President, is an amendment surely apposite.
The objection of form, urged to my other
proposition, is without any shadow of support here.
It is proposed in the bill to appropriate one hundred
thousand dollars to “bring to trial and punishment”
counterfeiters. The object is important, especially at
this moment, when we are putting in circulation national
securities on so large a scale. But suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
counterfeiter, in a State where the evidence of colored
persons is excluded, chooses to employ such persons
in his crime. How can you bring him to punishment?
All this large appropriation will not help then. It will
be of no avail. The counterfeiter, surrounded by colored
accomplices, may mock your laws. But admit the
testimony of these accomplices, and then will justice be
done. I refer to this class of cases because your bill
provides especially for them, and thus attests the importance
of precautionary effort.</p>

<p>But the hardship and absurdity of this rule, apparent
in the case of a counterfeiter surrounded by colored
accomplices, arise in every other case of crime.
How justice can be administered, where such a rule
prevails, I am at a loss to understand. Now that
Slavery is disappearing, this rule ought to disappear
also.</p>

<p>The subject has already been discussed at length,
during the present session, in an elaborate report
which I have had the honor of making from the Select
Committee on Slavery and Freedmen; so that I
need not occupy your time. Besides, the case is too
plain for argument. But I have in my hands letters
from gentlemen in Virginia, showing the practical
necessity of the testimony of colored persons there.
Here is one:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Hall of the Convention,<br />
Alexandria, Virginia</span>, March 17, 1864.</p>

<p>“I address thee as friend, although having no personal
acquaintance, but have long known thee by reputation as a
friend to the human race. Having been connected with the
reorganized government from its beginning, I naturally feel
a strong interest in its welfare.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
<p>“We have in Convention abolished slavery in the organic
law of the State, and it would at first sight seem as if our
fondest hopes were realized. But another difficulty now
stares us in the face, which, in the present state of public
opinion, we cannot conquer: I allude to the subject of allowing
the freedmen to give testimony in our courts. This
will not be allowed, where the interests of whites are involved.
The result that will follow any one can foresee,&mdash;that
their persons and property will be at the mercy of
every vagabond who may happen to have a black heart instead
of a black skin.</p>

<p>“While they were slaves, their masters were a protection
to them against others. Although there was not much law
looking that way, their owners being of the all-powerful
class in the communities in which they lived, their influence
answered the end very well. My object in writing was to
make thee acquainted with the probable future position of
these people, thinking it might be possible to ameliorate
their condition by some Federal legislation. While I speak
of Virginia, I have no doubt but that the same will be true
of the whole South, and will be a gigantic evil that may
lead to the most disastrous results. The negro, after this
war, will not be the same man as before: breathing the air
of freedom, trained to arms, understanding the power of
combination, and familiar with blood, it will be tampering
with a volcano to deny him protection of person and property.”</p>

</div>

<p>I do not give the name of this writer, because he is
unwilling that it should be known. But you will observe,
from the date of the letter, that he was a member
of the Virginia Convention. His testimony will
speak for itself. The other letter, as you will see, is
from the District Judge of Virginia.</p>

I am told by the United States Assistant Attorney in this

be subjected to costs, unless such testimony is allowed

<p>This is practical wisdom. Let me add to it proof from
another quarter. Sir Samuel Romilly, whose great fame
as a lawyer was enhanced by humane labors in Parliament,
has furnished evidence on this very point.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The laws of the Colonies are said to be humane; but
by those laws a child of five or six years old may receive,
for a slight offence or for no offence, at the caprice of the
master or overseer, no less than thirty-nine lashes with what
is termed a cart-whip. To this dreadful extent the law <em>authorizes</em>
the infliction of punishment by individuals. But
even in cases where the law conveys no authority, where
wanton cruelty is inflicted in defiance of the law, how easy
it must be to escape detection, when the testimony of a negro,
or a thousand negroes, would not avail against a white
man! And with what force must this argument strike,
when we reflect on the proportion which the white bear to
the black inhabitants of the island! What security could
we expect in our passage even through the streets of London,
if ninety-nine people out of a hundred, or even nine
out of ten, were incompetent to give evidence in a court of
justice?”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. President, in bringing forward this measure, I
waive for the present all questions of right, and, if you
please, all sentiments of humanity. I ask attention
plainly and directly to the practical failure of justice
which must arise without its adoption. This may be
seen under two different heads: first, with regard to
colored persons; and, secondly, with regard to white
persons.</p>

<p>If colored persons cannot testify against white persons,
what protection can they have against outrage?
The white person may perpetrate any brutality upon
colored persons with impunity. There is nothing in
the dreary catalogue of crime, from a simple assault to
murder itself, which may not be committed with impunity
by a white person, if no other white person be
present. This bare statement is enough. Surely at this
moment there should be no delay in preventing such
failure of justice.</p>

<p>But the same failure may occur in the case of white
persons. Let a white person be assaulted, or murdered,
if you please, by another white person, but only in the
presence of colored persons, and justice cannot be administered.
The criminal will continue at large unpunished.</p>

<p>Therefore, for the administration of justice, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
may not fail to the colored person, and then again that
it may not fail to the white person, there should be no
exclusion of any citizens on account of color.</p>

<p>Let the witness always be admitted to testify, leaving
the jury to be judges of his credibility. If his
story seems improbable, or there be anything in his
manner, conduct, or past life to excite distrust, the
jury will be able to measure the just weight of his
testimony.</p>

<p>It is hard to be obliged to argue this question. I do
not argue it. I will not argue it. I simply ask for
your votes. Surely, Congress will not adjourn without
redressing this grievance. The king, in Magna Charta,
promised that he would deny justice to no one. Congress
has succeeded to this promise and obligation.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman said he “trusted, that, after the experience of last
night, when the thermometer here rose to ninety-three degrees, and
we were all exhausted by a debate on irrelevant matter, the Senator
from Massachusetts would not introduce upon this appropriation bill
a topic of this kind.” He thought we had already voted on this
amendment on two other bills.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, after remarking that he had not been able to bring the
amendment applicable to the United States courts to a vote by itself,
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I can state to the Senator the different occasions
on which this principle prevailed. It prevailed on the
statute emancipating slaves in this District; but here
it was applicable only to cases arising in questions of
freedom under the statute. It was next broadened to
all proceedings in the courts of the District. But it
has not been applied beyond that. I have sought to
apply it generally; I have moved it more than once
on other bills, and have failed; and the measure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
now pending as a bill reported by the Select Committee
on Slavery and Freedmen, and it is also pending
as a section of another bill reported by the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>] from the Committee on
Post-Offices and Post-Roads. Therefore it has the approval,
as a general proposition, of two separate committees
of this body, while, as a proposition applicable
to the District of Columbia, it has had the sanction of
the Senate twice over; and now I plead with the Senate
not to arrest it here.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman replied: “I agree with the Senator in the general principle
entirely; but I hope he will not press the proposition as an
amendment to this bill, for I know it will create discussion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I believe it is always time for an act of justice, and
I think this Congress ought not to separate without this
act of justice. It ought to do it for the sake of the administration
of justice. I have not put this case, you
will bear witness, on any grounds of sympathy or sentiment
or humanity; I plead for it now as essential to
the administration of justice; and for one, as a Senator,
I cannot willingly abandon the opportunity afforded me
by my seat here of making this motion,&mdash;of making
this effort to open the courts of my country to evidence
without which justice must often fail.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Carlile, of Virginia, appealed to Mr. Sumner “to withdraw the
amendment, and allow this subject to rest, at least until the next session
of Congress.” This he declined to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, thereupon moved to amend the
amendment by adding, “nor in civil actions, because he is a party to
or interested in the issue tried.” Then came the following passage.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am in favor of that proposition, taken by
itself; but I do not wish it put upon this.</p>

other people say about yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understand that; but I wish to secure
this justice.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Buckalew.</span> I wish to secure the additional justice
provided by my amendment.</p>

itself. Let him move it when mine is carried.</p>

“nigger” aspect of this case. It is here every day, and I
suppose it will be here every day for years to come, till the
Democratic party comes into power and wipes out all legislation
on the statute-book of this character, which I trust
in God they will soon do.</p>

<p>The amendment of Mr. Buckalew was agreed to, and Mr. Sumner’s

<p>The effort at Reconstruction, which failed in the previous Congress,
was superseded at the present session by another, having, like the former,
as its distinctive feature, the assertion of the power of Congress
over the Rebel States.</p>

<p>February 15th, Henry Winter Davis, of Maryland, reported a bill to
guaranty to certain States, whose governments have been usurped or
overthrown, a republican form of government. This bill provided for
these States Provisional Governors, appointed by the President by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate; also, the assembling of
Constitutional Conventions, chosen by “loyal white male citizens,”
being a majority of the persons enrolled in the State, which shall declare
“involuntary servitude forever prohibited, and the freedom of all
persons guarantied in said State”; also, all slaves were declared emancipated,
and persons free by this or any other act or by “any proclamation
of the President” were protected in their freedom. After earnest
debate, this bill passed the House May 4th,&mdash;Yeas 74, Nays 66.</p>

<p>In the Senate the bill was referred to the Committee on Territories,
of which Mr. Wade was Chairman. May 27th, he reported it to the
Senate with amendments. July 1st, it was on his motion considered,
and, in order to save the bill at that late day of the session, he abandoned
the amendments reported, the most important of which was to
strike out the word “white,” so as to read “all male citizens of the
United States.” This amendment was rejected, by Yeas 5, Nays 24,&mdash;the
minority being Messrs. Gratz Brown, Lane, of Kansas, Morgan, of
New York, Pomeroy, of Kansas, and Sumner. Mr. Gratz Brown then
moved to substitute for the whole bill a single section, providing that
the inhabitants of a State declared to be in insurrection shall not cast
any vote for electors of President or Vice-President, or elect Senators
or Representatives in Congress, until the suppression of the insurrection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
“nor until such return to obedience shall be declared by proclamation
of the President, issued by virtue of an Act of Congress, hereafter
to be passed, authorizing the same.” This was in conformity with
propositions introduced by Mr. Sumner.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The House bill was unsatisfactory,
inasmuch as it founded the new governments on “white male
citizens”: but, besides asserting the power of Congress over the Rebel
States, it decreed the abolition of Slavery in these States; therefore
Mr. Sumner favored it. But the substitute of Mr. Brown prevailed,&mdash;Yeas
17, Nays 16.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then brought forward his bill, originally reported from
the Committee on Slavery and Freedmen, and moved it as an additional
section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Proclamation of Emancipation, issued
by the President of the United States on the 1st day of January, 1863,
so far as the same declares that the slaves in certain designated States and
portions of States thenceforward should be free, is hereby adopted and enacted
as a statute of the United States, and as a rule and article for the government
of the military and naval forces thereof.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, was in favor of this, but thought it
“incongruous and out of place here.” Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Senator from New Hampshire is entirely mistaken,
when he says that the section moved by me
is incongruous. The Senator whispers to me that he
did not say so.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> I beg his pardon; he began by saying
it was incongruous. It is entirely germane,&mdash;nothing
could be more germane. The section already adopted
concerns the Rebel States: that I offer concerns the
Rebel States. The Senator cannot vote against what I
now offer; it is neither more nor less than this: to recognize
as a statute the Proclamation of Emancipation,
putting it under the guaranty and safeguard of an Act
of Congress. That is all. It is as simple as day; it
is as plain as truth. It is impossible for any person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
recognizing the Proclamation of Emancipation, or disposed
to stand by it, to vote against the amendment I
now offer. I wish Emancipation in the Rebel States
supported by Congress. I am unwilling to see it left
afloat on a presidential proclamation. We are assured
that the Proclamation will not be changed; but who
knows what may be the vicissitudes of elections? I
do not look far enough into the future to see what proclamation
may be issued hereafter. I would make the
present sure, and fix it forevermore and immortal in
an Act of Congress.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, denounced the amendment as “an attempt
by Federal legislation to legislate for the States themselves, to
regulate their domestic institutions,&mdash;to control property, in other
words.” Mr. Gratz Brown said that the amendment, “as an independent
proposition, met his hearty concurrence”; that he concurred
heartily and fully with Mr. Sumner “as to the propriety of putting in
the shape of a statute that proclamation of the President”; but that it
ought not to be on the present bill, as it could not pass the House.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I adopt the language of my friend
from Missouri. He regards his proposition as necessary.
I regard his proposition, or something equivalent,
as necessary. But not less necessary do I regard that
which I have the honor to offer. His is to meet a
question in Reconstruction. Mine is to meet a similar
question.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brown.</span> Mine is not a proposition for Reconstruction,
at all. It is simply providing that they shall not exercise
the elective franchise until Congress authorizes it by Act.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understand it. The obvious effect
is to postpone all activities tending to Reconstruction,
and to bring them all under the rule of Congress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
That is the object of the Senator. And my present
object is to bring Emancipation under the rule of Congress,
so that it shall no longer depend on the Proclamation
of the President. I am unwilling that Emancipation
shall depend upon the will of any one man, be
he Senator or President. I would place it under the
highest sanction which our country knows. If I could,
I would place it at once under the shield of the Constitution;
but that failing, let me place it under that
other safeguard, an Act of Congress. I am sure the
Senator cannot differ with me. But the Senator,
whose experience here certainly does not compare
with that of others, assures us that this measure cannot
pass the other House. Sir, by what intuition has
he arrived at that knowledge? I have no means of
knowing that. On the contrary, if left to draw my conclusion
from what has already occurred, I say, unhesitatingly,
it can pass the other House. The Senator forgets,
that, when it reaches the other House, it will not
be as a bill, to go through its three different stages,&mdash;but
as an amendment to a House bill, subject only to
one stage of proceeding, with one vote. I tell the Senator
it can pass the other House. It only requires that
the Senate should send it there. Let us will it, and it
can be done; and I do entreat the Senator from Missouri,
who I know is pledged so strenuously to the
cause of Emancipation, not to fail it at this hour.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 21.</p>

<p>The bill, as amended by the substitute of Mr. Brown, then passed
the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 3. The House of Representatives disagreed
to the substitute, and asked a conference. The Senate, on motion
of Mr. Wade, receded from the substitute,&mdash;Yeas 18, Nays 14,&mdash;and
so the bill passed both Houses; but it failed to receive the approval
of the President of the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>July 2d, the Senate, on Mr. Sumner’s motion, proceeded to consider
this bill. Mr. McDougall, of California, said: “This attempt at aggregating
all power in the General Government tends to destroy the
positive exercise of the power of local institutions.… The Senator
from Massachusetts … undertakes to present this and other conterminous
things as a policy, so as to wipe out the lines of the States and
make one grand empire. That may be his policy. I have seen it indicated
from various quarters. It is revolutionary.… I have not the
right to promote such a corporation; he has not the right to promote
such a corporation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied briefly.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The answer is very simple. I have in my hand
the Statutes at Large, containing what was done
by the last Congress. Here is “An Act to incorporate
the National Academy of Sciences,” approved March 3,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
1863, setting forth the names of eminent, not to say
illustrious, men of science in our country, and constituting
them an Academy of Sciences. It will be remembered
that this Academy, during the present winter,
met in this Capitol; that one or more of our committee-rooms
were set apart for them; and I know that
many Senators and gentlemen of the other House took
great interest in their meetings. This Academy is devoted
to the cultivation of the sciences properly so
called.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. McDougall.</span> Will the Senator permit me to interrupt
him?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. McDougall.</span> There may be some questions about
which the Senator and myself may not understand each
other exactly. Of course we have the right to incorporate
an institution in the District of Columbia, that is local to
the District, by virtue of our general powers of legislation
over it; but that is not within the sphere of this legislation,
as I understand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Act of Congress to which I refer
is general in terms; it is not limited to the District;
it is a national act to create a National Academy: and
the bill before the Senate simply proposes to apply the
same principle to gentlemen engaged in the cultivation
of literature and art, also to gentlemen engaged in the
cultivation of history and those sciences which are connected
with morals and government. In the designation
of the two academies I have respected the example
of France, which is the country that has most excelled
in academies of this kind. I believe the Act of Congress
is sufficient as a precedent. I do not think there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
can be any just constitutional objection; and I am sure
that the association, if once organized, would give opportunities
of activity and of influence important to
the literature of the country. I hope there will be no
question about it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, wished to call up a bill from the House
of Representatives, relating to certain half-breeds of the Winnebago
Indians. “There is no chance of the pending bill passing the House
of Representatives. What, then, is the use of taking up time with it
here?” Mr. Morrill, of Maine, wished to introduce a bill to provide
for the Washington aqueduct. Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, thought
that “at this stage of the session it was a little too late to be engaged
in making a close corporation of mutual admirers,” and he moved to
take up a bill providing for the education of naval constructors and
steam-engineers. The last motion prevailed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 2d, late in the evening, this day being Saturday, it was proposed
that the session of Congress should finally close on Monday, July
4th, at noon. Mr. Sumner earnestly opposed this adjournment.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In determining when to adjourn
we may be guided by the experience of
the past. If earlier Congresses, having less to do, infinitely
less, than the present Congress, have found it
necessary to continue their sessions through the summer,
it is not improper to ask if we should be less industrious
and less persevering.</p>

<p>I have in my hand a memorandum of the adjournments
of Congress at the long session during the last
twenty years. It is most suggestive, at least, even if
not commanding to us.</p>

<p>The first session of the Twenty-Ninth Congress closed
August 10, 1846. The war with Mexico had just begun.
The first session of the Thirtieth Congress ended
August 14, 1848. The main discussion of this year
was on the Wilmot Proviso. The first session of the
Thirty-First Congress lasted till September 30, 1850.
This was the session of Compromise. The Fugitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Slave Act bears date September 18th of this year. The
first session of the Thirty-Second Congress did not close
till August 31, 1852. During this period the Compromise
measures were much discussed, also the Presidential
question, and the platforms of the two great parties.
It was as late as August 26th that I had the honor of
moving the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, being one
of the Slavery compromises adopted by the previous
Congress. The first session of the Thirty-Third Congress
adjourned August 7, 1854. This was early for
those times. The first session of the Thirty-Fourth
Congress adjourned August 30, 1856, Kansas being the
constant order of the day. Down to this period there
was no adjournment before August, and one Congress
sat as late as September 30th. But a change took
place.</p>

<p>In 1856 the old <i>per diem</i> of eight dollars, as compensation
of Senators and Representatives, was transmuted
into the present system of compensation by an annual
salary of three thousand dollars, be the session long or
short. See now what ensued. The first session of the
Thirty-Fifth Congress, immediately after the change of
pay, closed June 14, 1858; and yet the questions of
Kansas and the Lecompton Constitution were uppermost.
The first session of the Thirty-Sixth Congress
closed June 28, 1860, on the eve of the Presidential
election, having been much occupied by the crisis of
that historic conflict. Then came the long session of
the Thirty-Seventh Congress, which did not adjourn till
July 17, 1862, being a remarkable session, which has
stored the statute-book with monuments of its industry
and patriotism. Such is the record of the past; and
now it is proposed to adjourn on the 4th of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two suggestions with regard to this record,
which you will pardon me for making. First, so
long as Congress was paid at the rate of eight dollars a
day, and salary depended upon the duration of the session,
Congress sat late in the season. It is humiliating
to think that a consideration apparently so trivial
could have had such influence; but such are the facts.
The other suggestion is of a different character. It
appears, that, while the pretensions of Slavery were to
be upheld, Congress was willing to give up the whole
summer, even into autumn, to the odious theme. For
the sake of an execrable Fugitive Slave Act, and other
kindred measures, it bore all these heats, now so insupportable.</p>

<p>Sir, long ago I began the cry that we of the Free
States must be as earnest and positive for Freedom as
our opponents had always been for Slavery. Why not
imitate their example? Business did not draw them
away, heat did not drive them away, when Slavery was
in question. But Freedom in every form is now in
question. There is your army: it must be sustained.
There are your finances: must they not be sustained
also? There, too, are the great ideas of Freedom involved
in this war. Much as has been done to uphold
these, more remains to be done.</p>

<p>The question of finances assumes a practical form,
and, as I am informed, it is now under discussion in
the other House. While they debate an increased taxation,
we are here, close upon midnight, considering
how to end the session. That subject which of all
others is the most difficult and delicate, which touches
all the great interests of the country, which cannot be
treated in any hasty or perfunctory style, which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
be handled always with supremest caution, and which
at the present moment is almost a question of life and
death, is still to be considered by the Senate; and yet
Senators are willing, by fixing the hour of adjournment,
to see this most important debate “cabined, cribbed,
confined” to the limits of a few hours, I might almost
say minutes. Why, Sir, it has not yet been finally acted
on in the other House, and we know not when it can
reach us. But we know well, that, whenever it does
reach the Senate, the whole vast subject of taxation will
be open again. It is understood that the pending proposition
is for an increased income tax. In other times,
when Senators had not such uncontrollable longings for
home, such a measure would have been approached with
becoming care. But this is not the only question involved.
It is proposed to tax tobacco in the leaf, and
thus add millions to the revenue. And then we have
again the perpetually recurring question of taxing whiskey
on hand, destined to bring into our exchequer yet
other millions.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Have we not considered that?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I understand that at this moment it is under
consideration in the other House.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Has it not been under consideration for
months?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Of course it has; but it is under consideration
still. The two Houses, as the Senator knows well,
have differed. The other House favors taxing whiskey on
hand. The Senate has steadfastly resisted the tax. But
it is not too late for the Senate to yield, especially when
the necessity for more money is apparent, and the late distinguished
head of the Treasury has in a formal communication
recommended this very tax. There is no way in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>which so much money can be had so easily and so justly.
Let Congress stay together until the tax is laid. At all
events, do not leave without considering it again in the new
light. This is my answer to the Senator from Illinois.</p>

<p>But if you are unwilling to tax whiskey on hand, or
tobacco, then find something else to tax. But tax you
must. Tax, because of the necessity of the case. Tax,
because the people ask to be taxed. For the first time
in history the phenomenon occurs that the people rise
up and demand to be taxed. Unless I err, this is the
cry from every quarter. I know it is the cry from my
part of the country. It is a patriotic cry, because the
people believe further taxation essential to the national
credit and the safety of the country. All honor to the
people for this invitation to Congress!</p>

<p>And now Congress is about to leave, to flee away,
without performing this essential duty. A tax bill has
been passed, which already, before going into operation,
is pronounced inadequate in an official communication
by Mr. Chase. And yet, in despite of this judgment,
Senators are willing to go home. It is said we
need some hundred million dollars more; and yet, in
the face of this asserted necessity, and in the face of
that generous demand from every part of the country,
which Congress should make haste to gratify, it is now
urged that we should abdicate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Mr. President,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Let me finish. I will give the Senator
from Kentucky a fair opportunity in one moment.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I merely wish to ask a question.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well; I will answer it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> The question I ask the honorable Senator is,
whether he is not mistaken as to the subject of this great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>demand of the country,&mdash;whether, instead of being taxed, it
is not to have Slavery abolished everywhere. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Unquestionably there is a great demand
to have Slavery abolished everywhere, thank God! I present
petitions daily with this prayer. But another demand
at this moment is to make the war practical and efficient
by all needed supplies; and, as I have said, the people,
for the first time in history, ask to be taxed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Where are your petitions from the people for
it?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Petitions! They will be found in
the public press, and in the communications of constituents.
Formal documents are not needed. Gentlemen
have arrived here to-night, fresh from the people,
who are in themselves more than “petitions.” They
insist that there must be more taxation. Here, also,
is a telegraphic despatch, received this very evening,
signed by the first business men of Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“To Hon. <span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p>“It will be simply an act of madness for Congress to adjourn
without passing bills for large additional taxes, and
such other measures as the existing financial crisis demands.”</p>

</div>

<p>Language could not be stronger. Surely I am right
in saying that Congress ought not to turn a deaf ear to
this unprecedented prayer. At least, the prayer ought
to be considered. For myself, I wish not only to consider
it, but to supply the desired taxation, and I ask
that Congress shall continue in these seats until the
good work is done. Nay, more, Sir,&mdash;I protest against
any desertion until that work is done.</p>

<p>The great contest in which we are engaged depends
not only upon General Grant in the field, but upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Congress also. If Congress fails to supply the needed
means, vain is victory, vain are all the toils of many
hard-fought fields. It is through these means supplied
by Congress that the future will be secure. Do not deceive
yourselves by saying that you have already taxed
the country. The late distinguished Secretary of the
Treasury, in an authoritative communication, insists
that more means are needed. Do not set him aside
without at least considering his recommendation. On
such an occasion, when perhaps the life of the country
is in question, when surely the national credit is at
stake, err, if err you must, on the side of prudence.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is natural that Senators who have
been engaged for months in the labors of an anxious
session should be glad to escape from the confinement
and heat of Washington. I sympathize with them. I
wish to be away. I long to leave the capital. Did I
allow myself to take counsel of personal advantage, I
should be among the most earnest of those now crying
for adjournment. Born on the sea-shore, accustomed to
the sea air, I am less prepared than many of my friends
to endure the climate here. I feel sensibly its sultry
heats, and I pant for the taste of salt in the atmosphere.
Nor am I insensible to other influences. What little
remains to me of home and friendship is far away from
here,&mdash;where I was born. But home, friendship, and
sea-shore must not tempt me at this hour. Lord Bacon
tells us, in striking and most suggestive phrase, “The
duties of life are more than life.” But if ever there was
a time when the duties of a Senator were supreme above
all other things, so that temptation of all kinds should
be trampled under foot, it is now.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>An earnest debate ensued, in which Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>I take it, Sir, that the proceedings to-night are utterly
without precedent in the history of the Senate. It is
now more than two hours into Sunday morning. The
Senate has on former occasions sat Sunday morning, but
it was under the exigency of the Constitution, which
brought the session to a close on the 4th of March.
There is no such exigency now, and this Sunday morning
debate is instituted simply to secure an adjournment
of Congress on Monday. That is the single object of
all done here to-night,&mdash;all these strange proceedings,
making a sort of Walpurgis night of Sunday. But I say
nothing of incidental matters. I bring home the fact
that you now extend your session into Sunday merely
that you may hasten away on Monday. It is not for
any public exigency; it is not to pass any great measure;
it is not to comply with any requirement of the
Constitution; but simply to satisfy your own desires or
predilections to leave Washington on Monday.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, as to leaving Washington on Monday,
we are told that the other House wish to leave, and
that it has already disposed of the question of taxation
by sending us a proposition for an income tax, and the
Senator over the way [Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>, of Kansas], who tells
us he has kept such sharp look-out on the House to-night,
announces that all other propositions are discarded,
that there is to be no tax on tobacco, no tax upon
whiskey on hand, no tax on anything else, for the
House has come to its conclusion. Does the Senator
know, that, if Congress continues in session twenty-four
hours longer, or forty-eight hours longer, the House will
not be wiser and more patriotic? Does the Senator
who has kept such sharp look-out know that the House
will not rise at last to the requirements of the hour?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner was called to order by Mr. Richardson, of Illinois,
as reflecting on the other House, and the call was sustained by the presiding
officer, who said: “It has been practised too often on the part
of Senators to allude to the House of Representatives.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I hope I shall proceed in order. I
certainly did not intend to proceed out of order. I
was not aware that I was making any reflection on
the House of Representatives. We criticize very freely
each other; the members of one House criticize the
proceedings of the other House; and we criticize the
country, and the country criticizes us.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, we are told that the House has disposed of
the question of taxation. I am in order when I allude
to that. May we not hope, then, that, if the session is
extended a little longer, they will see the necessity of
increased taxation?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>He proceeded to develop again the necessity of taxation for the sake
of our finances, and especially of the national debt, “to the payment
of which the country is pledged.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner moved to substitute Tuesday, July 5th, at noon, for Monday,
July 4th, at noon. This was lost,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 22. The resolution
of adjournment was then adopted,&mdash;Yeas 20, Nays 11.</p>

<p>July 4th, shortly before adjournment at noon, the Senate acted
on the House bill imposing a special income tax of five per cent,
which was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 7.</p>

<p>At this meeting Governor Andrew presided and spoke. He was
followed by Hon. Alexander H. Rice, Hon. George S. Boutwell, Hon.
Henry Wilson, and General Cutler of the Army, when Mr. Sumner was
introduced. The report says: “He was received with great cheering
and the waving of hats and handkerchiefs for a considerable time.”
He at length spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Mayor and Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Listening to the gallant soldier now taking his
seat, I was reminded of the saying from the far
East, “Words are the daughters of Earth, but deeds are
the sons of Heaven.” [<i>Loud applause.</i>] A noble officer
comes before you, fresh from the Army of the Potomac;
but he gives words also which in themselves are
deeds [<i>renewed applause</i>], for he tells you plainly, truly,
how to meet the great issue before us. Sir, what has
been said so well, so bravely, and so eloquently by the
speakers who have addressed you leaves little for me.
I have not come to make a speech. The summons was
to assemble for congratulation upon those great victories
which have given assurance of the integrity of the
Union, and I am here for this purpose. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>We celebrate to-night two victories,&mdash;each a heavy
blow, under which the Rebellion reels and staggers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
its final fall. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Admiral Farragut, by a naval
expedition incomparable in the hardihood and skill with
which it was planned and executed, has occupied all
the approaches of Mobile, so that this important port
is now, thank God, hermetically sealed against those
English supplies which from the beginning have been
the source of encouragement and strength to the Rebellion.
[<i>Applause.</i>] General Sherman, on his part, by a
marvellous succession of battles and of marches, overcoming
obstacles interposed by Nature and a stubborn
foe, has shown triumphantly that our army can march
and then fight, march and then fight again, and conquer
[<i>applause, and “Good!”</i>], while by the capture of Atlanta
he has shattered the very key-stone of the Rebel
arch. [<i>Renewed applause.</i>] These, fellow-citizens, are
the victories we commemorate.</p>

<p>This is a season of joy, not that fellow-citizens in
arms against us have been overcome, not that blood is
flowing, not that fields and villages and towns are smoking,
but that our country is redeemed from peril, and
the public enemy is beaten down under our feet. [<i>Long
continued applause.</i>] Such is the occasion of rejoicing
to-night. Hearts overflow, eyes glisten, the voice cries
out with gladness, the heart echoes to the booming cannon,
and victory thrills us all with its bewitching, triumphant
music. This, Sir, is the time to rejoice: for
there is a time to lament, and there is a time also to
enjoy; and this is a time for joy. “Blow, bugles, blow!
set all your wild notes flying!”</p>

<p>Unhappy those who cannot unite in our joy! Unhappy
those who, as they listen to the triumphant salvos,
to the swelling music, and to these exultant voices
here to-night, cannot echo them back with gladness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
their hearts! Unhappy all such, who call themselves
by the American name! And why can they not rejoice?
Alas! it is because their sympathies are with
the enemy, or because they place party above country,
even to the extent of seeing that country cut in twain
[<i>A voice, “Shame!”</i>], like the false mother who appeared
for judgment before Solomon. The wise monarch
clearly perceived that a woman ready to see her
child divided in two was a false mother: so may we
all clearly perceive that people ready to see their country
divided in two are false citizens. The judgment of
Solomon stands good to this hour, against all showing
such perfidious insensibility.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, these Northern renegades (I like to
call things by their proper names, and I thank my honored
friend who preceded me for his exposition, telling
how near they come to being traitors)&mdash;these Northern
renegades are nothing else than unarmed guerrilla bands
of Jefferson Davis, marauding here at the North. [<i>Loud
cheers.</i>] They cry out, “<em>Peace!</em>”&mdash;but, fellow-citizens,
are we not all for peace? Sir, are you not for peace?
Are not all the honored gentlemen by whom I am surrounded
for peace? Peace is the sentiment, the longing,
the passion of my life. Not Falkland in the bloody
days of the English civil war cried, “<em>Peace! Peace!</em>”
more fervently than I do now. For me the day begins,
continues, and ends with this aspiration; but it
is precisely because I am thus determined for peace,
because peace is with me such a be-all and end-all, that
I now insist, at all hazards, that this Rebellion shall be
overthrown and trampled out at once and utterly, so
that it shall never again break forth in blood. [<i>Loud
cheers.</i>] In the name of peace, and for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
good-will among men, do I now insist that this Rebellion
shall be so completely blasted as to leave behind
no root or remnant which may become the germ of
future war.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, let me be frank, for such is my habit,
here, or wherever else I have the honor to speak. In
vain do you expect to destroy the Rebellion, unless you
destroy Slavery [<i>applause</i>]; for Slavery, be assured, is
but another name for the Rebellion. The two are synonyms;
they are convertible terms. The Rebellion is
but Slavery in arms, whether on land or on sea; on
foot, on horseback, or afloat, it is ever belligerent Slavery,
warring to establish a wicked empire. If you are
against one, you must be against the other. If you are
ready to strike Rebellion, you must be ready to strike
Slavery. If you are ready to strike Slavery, you must
be ready to strike Rebellion. The President was clearly
right, when, in a recent letter, he declared that he
should accept no terms of peace which did not begin
with the abandonment of Slavery. [<i>“Good!” and cheers.</i>]
The Union cannot live with Slavery. Nothing can be
clearer. If Slavery dies, the Union lives; if Slavery
lives, the Union dies. God save the Union!</p>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, it only remains that you
should comprehend the grandeur of the cause and of
your position. Consider well the Thermopylæ pass in
which you stand battling for Liberty,&mdash;not only here
at home, but everywhere throughout the globe; and forget
not, that, if you take care of Liberty, the Union will
take care of itself,&mdash;or, better still, know, that, if you
save Liberty, you save everything. [<i>Loud cheers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. John C. Gray</span> presided at this meeting.</p>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;I do not speak to-night in
the belief that anything in the way of speech,
from me or anybody else, can add to the certainty
that Abraham Lincoln will be reëlected President of
the United States. This event is already fixed beyond
doubt or question. [<i>Applause.</i>] It is the clear, palpable,
visible will of the American people, which only
waits the official record of the 8th of November next.
The case is plain. Everybody who voted for him four
years ago will vote for him now, while others, like
Edward Everett [<i>cheers</i>], who voted against him before,
will gladly range among his supporters. Here is a
sum of simple addition, requiring very little arithmetic.
But it is not astonishing that persons who have
lost their patriotism should lose the power of calculation
also.</p>

<p>And here let me remark, that, in taking a place at
the head of our ticket,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> the distinguished gentleman to
whom I have referred renders a patriotic service, and
sets an example to all Bell-Everett men, who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
prefer to follow Bell rather than Everett. If any belonging
to that extinct combination vote against Edward
Everett, it will be only to find themselves in the company
of the traitor, John Bell. If you choose to give
them a designation, let it be simply “Bell men.” It
remains to be seen how many, at this crisis, prefer the
traitor to the patriot. These two names, once in conjunction,
now represent the two hostile ideas of Rebellion
and Patriotism.</p>

<p>Even if the election be certain, our duty is none the
less imperative. It is certain, because every good citizen
will do his duty, and will see that his neighbor
does it, too. It is certain, because, thank God, Patriotism
at the North is stronger than Rebellion. [<i>Cheers.</i>]
But we must all unite to make it gloriously certain.</p>

<p>I have often, on former occasions, when addressing
my fellow-citizens, put the question, “Are you for Freedom,
or are you for Slavery?”&mdash;and I put this question
now; for it is the question which necessarily enters
into the coming election. On the answer hinges absolutely
the peace of our country and the perpetuity of
our institutions. Therefore I put the question in another
form: “Are you for your country, or are you for
the Rebellion?” That is the question to decide by
your votes. It is vain to evade this question, vain to
wink it out of sight. It will come to every man as
he puts in his vote, and he should decide it sincerely,
patriotically, religiously.</p>

<p>And now, that I may bring this responsibility home
to mind and conscience, I have no hesitation in saying,
that, in voting against Abraham Lincoln, you will not
only vote against Freedom and for Slavery, but you will
vote against your country and for the Rebellion,&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
short, you will give the very vote which Jefferson Davis
would give, were he allowed to vote in Massachusetts.
No matter under what excuse this may be done, no
matter by what argument you may deceive yourselves,
no matter what apology you may construct, founded,
perhaps, on personal objections or personal partialities,&mdash;it
will be all the same. Your vote will be a vote
against Freedom,&mdash;ay, Sir, a vote against your country.
Just to the extent of its influence, you will give aid and
comfort to the Rebel enemy, and will prevent the restoration
of Union and Peace.</p>

<p>There can be no third party now, whether in the
name of moderation or in the name of progress,&mdash;as
there can be no third party between right and wrong,
between good and evil, between the Almighty Throne
and Satan. There can be but two parties here. Choose
ye between them. One is the party of the country,
with Abraham Lincoln as its chief, and with Freedom
as its glorious watchword; and the other is the party
of the Rebellion, with Jefferson Davis as its chief,
and with no other watchword than Slavery. As in the
choice of Hercules, there are here before you two roads,&mdash;one
leading to virtue and renown, the other leading
to crime and shame. Choose ye between them. Vote
against Abraham Lincoln, if you can, or stay at home
and sulk, if you will; you have only, as a next step, to
go over to the enemy.</p>

<p>There is now no question of candidates; there is no
question of men. Candidates and men, no matter who,
are all insignificant by the side of the cause. It is the
cause we sustain and would bear, as the ark of the covenant,
on our shoulders. Therefore I put aside all that
is said of the two candidates. It would be useless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
attempt comparison between them, although it might
appear, that, in those matters where one has been most
criticized, the other is in the same predicament,&mdash;that,
if Lincoln is slow, McClellan is slower,&mdash;that, if Lincoln
has employed the military arm in the arrest of individuals,
McClellan has employed it in the arrest of a
whole Legislature,&mdash;and that, if Lincoln drove Vallandigham
out of the Union lines as a penalty for sedition,
McClellan drove the Hutchinsons out of the Union
lines as a penalty for singing songs of Freedom. But
why consider these petty personalities? They divert
attention from the single question, “Are you for your
country, or are you for the Rebellion?” [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I have said that there are but two parties. If you
would understand their respective characters and their
claims to support, glance, first, at their history, and
then at the principles they have recently declared.</p>

<p>On one side is the Republican party, originally
formed to check the encroachments of Slavery, and especially
to save the vast territories of the Republic, preserving
them forever sacred to Freedom. Such a party,
originally formed with such an object and inspired by
Freedom, was the natural defender of the Republic,
when Slavery took up arms against it. To this end it
has labored, and to this end it will continue to labor,
until, by the blessing of God, the Union is once again
restored. I call it the Republican party, because that
was its early name; but, for myself, I am indifferent to
the name by which you call me. Let it be Republican,
Unionist, or Abolitionist, what you will, I am with
those patriots who stand by their country, seeking its
safety and renown. [<i>Great applause.</i>]</p>

<p>It is sometimes asked, What has the Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
party done? Look around, and you will see everywhere
what it has done. Its acts are historic. Slavery
and the Black Laws all abolished in the national capital;
Slavery interdicted in all the national territories;
Hayti and Liberia recognized as independent republics
in the family of nations; the foreign slave-trade placed
under the ban of a new treaty with Great Britain; the
coastwise slave-trade prohibited forever; all persons in
the military or naval service prohibited from returning
slaves; all Fugitive Slave Acts repealed; the rule
excluding colored testimony in the national courts abolished;
and slaves set free in the Rebel States by Presidential
proclamation: such are some of the triumphs
of Freedom, under the auspices of the Republican party.
[<i>Cheers.</i>] But this is not all. The Pacific Railroad is
at last authorized; agricultural colleges are provided
for; homesteads on the public lands are offered to all
actual settlers; while, by special legislation, emigration
is encouraged and organized. But beyond all these
measures, any one of which in other days would have
illumined a whole administration, the National Government,
acting in self-defence, with Abraham Lincoln as
its head, has set on foot one of the largest armies of
which there is any authentic record,&mdash;has equipped
a navy which, in the variety and completeness of its
power, with all modern improvements, may vie with
any in the world,&mdash;while, by a most successful financial
system, including banks and credit, it has obtained
the unprecedented sums required for all this
enormous preparation.</p>

<p>All this is the work of the Republican party in less
than a single Presidential term. [<i>Prolonged applause.</i>]
It remains for this party to crown its transcendent labors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
by completing the triumph of the Union, and by
establishing peace on the indestructible foundation of
human rights. I regard it as an honor to belong to this
party, so great in what it has already accomplished, and
greater still in what it proposes. Other parties have
performed their work and perished. The Republican
party will live forever in the gratitude of all who love
Liberty and rejoice in the triumphs of Civilization.
Foreign countries will take up the strain, while the
down-trodden and the oppressed everywhere confess
that their burdens have been lifted by an irresistible
influence which we are assembled to advance. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Against the Republican party, thus patriotic, and already
illustrious by achievements, is arrayed the old
Democratic party, galvanized into new life, and reinforced
by members of the old Bell-Everett party who
prefer Bell to Everett. In this strange combination,
where Herod and Pilate are made friends to destroy
human freedom, there seems but one single element
of cohesive attraction, and that is Slavery; and these
men all call themselves Democrats.</p>

<p>Pardon the frankness with which I speak: it is
needful in order to disclose the actual character of the
Opposition. For a true Democracy, founded on the
rights of man, I have an unfeigned respect; but for a
pretended Democracy, founded on human slavery, and
existing only for this enormous crime, I have no respect.
It is an inconsistency in terms. It is a flat
contradiction. It is a cheat and a sham. And such is
the Democracy which here in Massachusetts, headed
by Robert C. Winthrop, now arrays itself against the
party of Union, headed by Edward Everett. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
plain, that, in pursuing this course, it follows naturally
and simply the traditions of the party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have exhibited something of the good accomplished
by the Republican party. See now what has been done
by the Democratic party, and then say what evil may
not be expected from it.</p>

<p>For years the Democratic party has been the supporter
of Slavery, prompt in yielding to its insatiate
demands.</p>

<p>Look at the Rebellion from beginning to end, and
you will find it has been engineered by Democrats.</p>

<p>You cannot forget that James Buchanan, a Democrat,
was President, surrounded by a Democratic Cabinet,
while the Rebellion was allowed to organize and
gather strength without interruption.</p>

<p>Wherever you look in the Rebellion, there you find
the old Democracy, into which is absorbed John Bell
and his followers, arrayed against their country.</p>

<p>Look at individuals; you find that the larger half,
constituting the controlling power of the old Democratic
party, are now in arms against their country.</p>

<p>Look at States; you find that all in rebellion were
at its outbreak Democratic States.</p>

<p>Look at the present upholders of the Rebellion, and
you find that all, without exception, most active, were
Democrats,&mdash;that Jefferson Davis, the President, so
tenacious and uncompromising, was a Democrat,&mdash;that
Stephens, the audacious Vice-President, who announced
that the new Government was founded on Slavery as
its corner-stone, was an old Whig turned into a Democrat,&mdash;that
all the Rebel Cabinet were Democrats,&mdash;that
the President of the Rebel Senate and the Speaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
of the Rebel House were Democrats,&mdash;that James M.
Mason and John Slidell, the Rebel emissaries in Europe,
were Democrats,&mdash;that the officers, who, after
obtaining their education at West Point at the public
expense, threw up their commissions and lifted parricidal
hands against their country, Hood, Beauregard,
Johnston, Lee, were all Democrats.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Northern associates and allies of
these Rebels are engaged in devising apologies for Rebellion.
Naturally, they are against all energetic measures
for its suppression; they call for a “cessation of
hostilities,” and seek to throw over their companions of
other days every possible protection, especially seeking
by all means to save their darling Slavery. But they
ought not to find sympathy with patriot citizens,&mdash;especially
against the Republican party, which, in its
open and unconditional patriotism, and in all its manifold
works, is in marked contrast with the Democracy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, in all this vast Union, whether as it
was or as it is, there is not a single Republican in arms
against the Government, or sympathizing with those
who are. There is not a traitor among them. Here is
a distinction between the two parties broad as the space
between earth and heaven. [<i>Great applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I would not confound the innocent with the guilty.
I know full well that among the honest masses there
are many, once Democrats, who have given their lives
to their country, and there are some of the old leaders
at the North who have spurned all the traditions of the
party. All honor and gratitude to them! There, also,
are our generals,&mdash;Grant, Sherman, Hooker, Butler,&mdash;a
goodly cluster,&mdash;once Democrats, but now forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
party and dedicating themselves completely to their
country. But the patriotism of Democrats like these
is not an apology for the Democrat Jefferson Davis, or
for his Democratic sympathizers among us, seeking to
arrest the strong blows under which Rebellion reels. I
do not forget, also, that there are good men, who, under
misapprehension of some kind, and without seeing all
the bearings of their conduct, have allowed themselves
to be swept into the Democratic ranks. But such as
these can be no cloak to that Democratic party which
at Chicago openly struck hands with Jefferson Davis,
and undertook to do for him what he cannot do for
himself.</p>

<p>It is because the Democratic party is at this moment
so utterly mischievous and disloyal, so really dangerous
to our country, and so bitterly hostile to Liberty, that I
speak thus plainly. Soft words will not do in exposing
that combination at Chicago, where the two factions
commingled into one. Call them, if you please, Pharisees
and Sadducees. [<i>Laughter.</i>] They are something
more, and something worse, if possible. They are the
unarmed guerrilla bands of Jefferson Davis, who have
stolen into the Free States. I have used this language
before. If I repeat it now, it is because I wish to put
you on your guard against criminal marauders, who, at
this moment of peril, are ready to prey upon their
country.</p>

<p>If you would see the difference between the two parties,
read the speeches and resolutions at Baltimore, and
then the speeches and resolutions at Chicago. I have
no time for details, even if the transactions at these two
Conventions were not still fresh in the memory. Suffice
it to say that the Convention at Baltimore openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
and frankly pledged all its energies to the suppression
of the Rebellion, and to the utter and complete extirpation
of Slavery from the soil of the Republic, without
compromise or hesitation of any kind. This was noble
and patriotic. But nothing of this kind was done at
Chicago.</p>

<p>The Chicago platform may be seen in two aspects,&mdash;first,
in what it does say, and, secondly, in what it
does not say. There are two things it does say: first,
that the war for the suppression of the Rebellion is
a failure; and, secondly, that there should be a cessation
of hostilities. There are two things it does not
say: first, it does not say anything against the Rebellion;
and, secondly, it does not say anything against
Slavery. And candidates are nominated on this platform.
In voting for them, you affirm that the war has
failed and that it ought to be stopped, while you decline
to say anything against the Rebellion or against
Slavery. You declare that our recent triumphs were
all failures, that Grant failed at Vicksburg, that Sherman
failed at Atlanta, that Farragut failed at New Orleans
and Mobile, that Winslow failed against the Alabama,
and that Sheridan failed in the Valley of the
Shenandoah; and you further declare that all these
heroes should be arrested in mid-career, while Democratic
agencies take their place, and rose-water is substituted
for cannon-balls. And you declare, also, that
the Rebellion shall prevail, and that Slavery shall continue
to degrade our country and be the seed of interminable
war. All this you affirm and declare by
your votes.</p>

<p>If anything were needed to illustrate the offensive
character of this platform, it would be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
efforts made to get away from it,&mdash;at least in this latitude.
Nobody here is willing to trust it. The cry of
the railroad conductor is transferred to politics,&mdash;“It is
dangerous to stand on the platform.” [<i>Laughter.</i>] Nobody
has made greater efforts to get away from it than
the Presidential candidate of the Democracy, who forgets,
that, as a candidate, he is born with the platform,
and united to it, as the Siamese twins are united together,
so that the two cannot be separated. As well
cut apart Chang and Eng as cut apart McClellan and
Chicago. [<i>Laughter.</i>] The two must go together.</p>

<p>The letter of McClellan is a specimen of “how not to
do it.” This is the prevailing idea,&mdash;how not to stand
on the platform, how not to offend the Rebels, and how
not to touch Slavery. It is an ingenious wriggle and
twist; but so far as the writer succeeds in getting off
the platform, it is only to run upon other difficulties,&mdash;as
from Scylla to Charybdis. The platform surrenders
to the Rebellion; the letter surrenders to Slavery.
But the Rebellion is nothing but belligerent Slavery; so
that surrender to Slavery is surrender to the Rebellion.
The platform discards the Union; but the letter, while
professing a desire for union, discards Emancipation,
without which union is impossible; and while professing
a desire for peace, it discards Liberty, through which
alone peace can be secured. The letter says: “The Union
is the one condition of peace: <em>we ask no more</em>.”
The Democratic candidate may ask no more; but others
do. <em>I ask more</em>, because without more the Union is
but a name. I ask more for the sake of justice and humanity,
and that this terrible war may be vindicated in
history. The Baltimore Convention, in its resolutions,
<em>asks more</em>. Abraham Lincoln <em>asks more</em>. The country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
takes up the demand of the Baltimore Convention and
of Abraham Lincoln, and <em>asks more</em>. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I have said that Abraham Lincoln <em>asks more</em>. He
has asked it again and again. He asked it in his Proclamation
of the 1st January, 1863, when, as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy of the United States,
he ordered and declared that the slaves in the Rebel
States “are and <em>henceforward shall be free</em>, and that the
Executive Government of the United States, including
the military and naval authorities thereof, <em>will recognize
and maintain the freedom of said persons</em>.” And he
asked it again, when, in his notice “To whom it may
concern,” he announced that all terms of peace must
begin with “the abandonment of Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But, in
face of these declarations, the candidate of the Democrats
mumbles forth, “The Union is the one condition
of peace: <em>we ask no more</em>.”</p>

<p>It is a strange infatuation which imagines that the
Rebellion can be closed without the entire abolition of
Slavery. The Rebellion began with Slavery, and it will
end with Slavery. As it began in no other way, so it
can end in no other way. Born from Slavery, it must
die with Slavery. Therefore do I insist that Slavery
shall not be spared; for, in sparing Slavery, you spare
the Rebellion itself. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>But even if reason and the necessity of the case did
not require the sacrifice, it is now too late, thank God!
By the Proclamation of the President the freedom of
all slaves in the Rebel region is secured beyond recall.
That gift cannot be taken back. It was a saying of Antiquity,
repeated by an exquisite poet of our own day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
that “the gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.”
But even if other gifts may be recalled, the gift of Freedom
cannot; for its recall would be the sacrifice of human
rights. Every slave declared free by that Proclamation
is entitled to his freedom as much as you and I.
The President himself, empowered to confer freedom, is
impotent to make a slave. Look at the question as you
will, in the light of morals or of jurisprudence, and the
answer is the same. There is the promise of the Proclamation,
by which the public faith of the country is
irrevocably pledged that certain slaves “shall be henceforward
free,” and their freedom shall be “recognized
and maintained”; and this promise, according to morals,
cannot be taken back. Still more, according to jurisprudence,
it cannot be taken back; for “Once free, always
free” is a prevailing maxim, and no court, sitting
under the Constitution, and inspired by the Declaration
of Independence, can venture to limit or restrain
a proclamation of freedom, made in the exercise of war
powers for the suppression of rebellion. It is vain to
say that the slaves are not now in our power. This is
a proper argument for the enemy, but not for any court
of the United States. Every such court refusing to
recognize the act of the President will stultify itself
and shock the judicial conscience of mankind. It is
enough that the Proclamation has declared the slaves
free. There is not a slave in the Rebel region who
may not look to it for protection, while it overarches
all like a firmament, which human effort will strive in
vain to drag down. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Do you need authority for this principle? Let me
read you the emphatic and well-considered words of
Postmaster-General Blair:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The people once slaves in the Rebel States can never
again be recognized as such by the United States. <span class="smcap">No
judicial decision, no legislative action, State or National</span>,
can be admitted to reënslave a people who are associated
with our own destinies in this war of defence to
save the Government, and whose manumission was deemed
essential to the restoration and preservation of the Union,
<em>and to its permanent peace</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>This is noble doctrine; and it is none the less noble
because from a member of the Cabinet sometimes supposed
to hesitate where Freedom is in question.</p>

<p>See, then, into what denial of just principles, as well
as inconsistencies, you are led, when you follow the
Democratic candidate in rejecting Freedom as the corner-stone
of Union.</p>

<p>But I have said enough. The case is too plain for
argument. Let me give it to you in a nutshell.</p>

<p>A vote for McClellan will be, first and foremost, a
vote for Slavery, at a time when this crime has plunged
the country into the sorrow and waste of war.</p>

<p>It will be, also, a vote for the Rebellion, at a moment
when the Rebellion is nigh to fall.</p>

<p>Also, a vote for Disunion, at a moment when the
Union is about to be made inseparable.</p>

<p>But disunion, when once started, cannot be stopped;
so that a vote for McClellan will be a vote to break
this Union in pieces, and to set each State spinning
in space.</p>

<p>It will be a vote for chronic war among fellow-citizens,
ever beginning and never ending, until the fate of
Mexico will be ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>Also, a vote for the repudiation of the national debt,
involving the destruction of property and the overthrow
of business.</p>

<p>Also, a vote for anarchy and chaos at home.</p>

<p>Also, a vote for national degradation abroad.</p>

<p>Also, a vote against the civilization of the age.</p>

<p>Also, a vote for the kingdom of Satan on earth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a vote for Abraham Lincoln will
be, first and foremost, a vote for Freedom, Union, and
Peace, that political trinity under whose guardianship
we place the Republic. It will be a vote, also, to fix
the influence and good name of our country, so that it
shall become the pride of history. It will be a vote,
also, for civilization itself. At home it will secure
tranquillity throughout the land, with freedom of travel
and of speech, so that the eloquence of Wendell Phillips
may be enjoyed at Richmond and Charleston
as at New York and Boston, and the designation of
“Border States,” now exclusively applicable to interior
States, will be removed, so that our only “Border
States” will be on Canada at the North and Mexico at
the South. Doing all this at home, it will do more
abroad; for it will secure the triumph of American institutions
everywhere. [<i>Great applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Surely all this is something to vote for. And you
will not hesitate. Forward, then,&mdash;in the name of
Freedom, Union, and Peace! Crush the enemy everywhere.
Crush him on the field of battle. Crush him
at the ballot-box. And may the November election be
the final peal of thunder which shall clear the sky and
fill the heavens with glory! [<i>Prolonged cheers.</i>]</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The following speech<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> was delivered by Senator Sumner at Cooper Institute,
New York, on the afternoon of Saturday, November 5, 1864, before
one of the largest audiences ever assembled within the walls of that capacious
hall. By this publication, the Young Men’s Republican Union, at
whose invitation the speech was delivered, brings to a close the arduous
labors of its third Presidential campaign,&mdash;the last of a series of political
battles, begun, prosecuted, and completed in the interest and for the furtherance
of the principles so nobly and eloquently reasserted in the Massachusetts
Senator’s last and greatest speech.</p>

<p>Among the auditors, on this occasion, were at least two hundred clergymen,
of all denominations, from New York, Brooklyn, Newark, and other
adjacent cities. Not less than one thousand ladies, and an equal number of
the most eminent citizens of New York, also aided to swell the crowd that
assembled to do honor to the distinguished orator, and to express the sympathy
and interest they felt in the great cause in whose behalf he was announced
to plead.</p>

<p>Besides Francis Lieber, LL. D., the widely known Professor of Political
Science in Columbia College, who was chosen Chairman of the meeting by
acclamation, there were upon the platform many of the men and women of
New York whose names and deeds in various walks of life have illustrated
the annals of Freedom’s trials and triumphs in America.</p>

<p>Dr. Lieber, upon taking the chair, made a brief and appropriate address,
at the close of which he introduced Hon. Edwin D. Morgan, who read a telegram,
received from San Francisco, giving assurance of a Union victory in
California: the reading of this despatch was hailed with applause and cheers.
When order had been restored, the Chairman presented the orator of the occasion,
who was made the recipient of an ovation such as has seldom been
accorded to a speaker in New York.</p>

<p>The speech, throughout, was received with every evidence of enthusiasm
and approval on the part of the vast audience, the applause frequently interrupting
the speaker for several moments, and at times causing the hall to
become the scene of the wildest excitement. Few of those who were successful
in securing admission on this occasion will forget the rounds of applause,
the hearty cheers, the clapping of fair hands, and the waving of hundreds
of snowy handkerchiefs, by which the swarming crowd so often testified
its appreciation of Mr. Sumner’s scholarly diction, effective eloquence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>and patriotic, statesmanlike utterance of these great political truths. It is
but simple truth to say, that none of the many political meetings of the
campaign, in New York, could at all compare with this mass meeting of the
flower of our citizenship, whether regard be had to the numbers, intelligence,
social position, or sound sentiments of loyalty, which were the characteristics
of the great gathering of November 5th, 1864.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;In all the concerns of life,
the first necessity is to see and comprehend the
circumstances about us. Without this knowledge human
conduct must fail. Without this knowledge the
machine cannot be worked, the ground cannot be tilled,
the ship cannot be navigated, war cannot be waged,
government cannot be conducted. The old Greek, suddenly
enveloped in a cloud while battling with his enemies,
exclaimed, “Give me to see!”&mdash;and this exclamation
of the warrior is the exclamation, also, of every
person in practical life, whether striving for country or
only for himself. “Give me to see,” that I may comprehend
my duty. “Give me to see,” that I may
recognize my enemy. “Give me to see,” that I may
know where to strike.</p>

<p>The wise physician, before any prescription for his
patient, endeavors, by careful diagnosis, to ascertain the
nature of the disease or injury, and when this is done,
he proceeds with confidence. Without such knowledge
all medical skill must fail. You do not forget how it
failed in the recent case of the Italian patriot, Garibaldi,
suffering cruelly from a wound in the foot, received
at the unfortunate battle of Aspromonte, which for
a long time nobody seemed to understand. Eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
surgeons of different countries were at fault. At last
Nélaton, the liberal professor of the Medical School at
Paris, leaving pupils and patients, journeyed into Italy
to visit the illustrious sufferer. Other surgeons said
that there was no ball lodged in the foot; the French
surgeon, after careful diagnosis, declared that there was,
and at once extracted it. From that time Garibaldi
gained in health and strength, thanks to his scientific
visitor, who was enabled to understand his case.</p>

<p>Nowhere is diagnosis more important than in national
affairs. Men are naturally patriotic. They love their
country with instinctive love, quickened at the mother’s
knee, and nursed in the earliest teachings of the school.
For country they offer fortune and life. But while thus
devoted, they do not always clearly see the line of duty.
Local prejudice, personal antipathy, and selfish interest
obscure the vision. And far beyond all these is the
disturbing influence of “party,” with all the power of
discipline and organization added to numbers. Men
attach themselves to a political party as to a religion,
and yield blindly to its behests. By error of judgment,
rather than of heart, they give up to party what was
meant for country or mankind. I do not condemn political
parties, but warn against their tyranny. A patriotic
Opposition, watchful of the public service, is hardly
less important than a patriotic Administration. They
are the complements of each other, and, even while in
open conflict, unite in duty to country. But a political
party which ceases to be patriotic, which openly takes
sides with Rebellion, which sends up “blue lights” as
a signal to an armed foe, or which subtly undermines
those popular energies now needed for the national defence,
that the Republic may live,&mdash;such a party is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
engine of frightful evil, to be abhorred as “the gates of
hell.” It is, unhappily, an evil of party always, even in
its best estate, that it tends to dominate over its members,
so as to create an oligarchical power, a sort of <i>imperium
in imperio</i>, which may overshadow the Government
itself. This influence becomes disastrous beyond
measure, when bad men obtain control or bad ideas prevail.
Then must all who are not ready to forget their
country consider carefully the consequences of their
conduct. Adherence to party may leave but one step
to treason.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, I address you as patriots who love
their country and would not willingly see it suffer,
who rejoice in its triumphs and long to behold its flag
furled in peace. But it is the nature of true patriotism
to love country most when it is most in peril. As dangers
thicken and skies darken, the patriot soul is roused
by internal fire so that no sacrifice seems too great.
And now, when the national life is assailed by traitors
at home, while foreign powers look on with wicked
sympathy, I begin by asking that you should forget
“party” and all its watchwords. Think only of country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is much misconception, even among well-meaning
persons, with regard to the object of the war, while
partisans do not tire of misrepresenting it. A plain
statement will show the truth as it is.</p>

<p>It is often said that the object of the war on our part
is simply to restore the Constitution, and much mystification
is employed with regard to the essential limits
of such a contest. Mr. Crittenden’s resolution, adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
by both Houses of Congress, declared that the war was
“not waged on our part in any spirit of oppression,
or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, <em>or purpose
of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established
institutions of the Southern States</em>,&mdash;but to defend
and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to
preserve the Union, <em>with all the dignity, equality, and
rights of the several States unimpaired</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> I rejoice to
remember that I did not vote for this resolution. It
was unsatisfactory to me at the time, and is more unsatisfactory
now. While plausible in form, it was in
the nature of a snare.</p>

<p>Again, it is said that the object of the war is to abolish
Slavery. This, also, is a mistake, although it is generally
urged by those who seek occasion to criticize the
war, and therefore it is in the nature of misrepresentation.
At the beginning of the war, and during its early
stages, Slavery was left untouched, in the enjoyment of
peculiar immunity, such as was accorded to no other
Rebel interest. If this peculiar immunity has been discontinued,
it is only because Slavery is at last seen in
its true character, and because its absolute identity with
the Rebellion has come to be recognized.</p>

<p>Not, then, to restore the Constitution, not to abolish
Slavery, do we go forth to battle,&mdash;for neither of these,&mdash;but
simply <em>to put down the Rebellion</em>. It is this, and
nothing more. Never in history was there a war with
an object so manifest. If, in the process of putting
down the Rebellion, the Constitution shall be completely
restored or Slavery shall be completely abolished, the
war will still be the same in essential object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>From its origin you will see its true character beyond
question. Certain slave-masters, after long years
of conspiracy, rose against the Republic and struck at
its life. The reason assigned for this parricide was
strange as the deed. It was simply because the people
of the United States, by constitutional majority,
according to prescribed forms of law, had elected Abraham
Lincoln as President. On this alleged reason, and
to defeat his administration, Rebellion was organized.
You are familiar with the succession of parricidal blows
that ensued. State after State, beginning with South
Carolina, always traitorous, undertook to withdraw
from the Union. Their Senators and Representatives in
Congress actually withdrew from the National Capitol,
leaving behind menaces of war. Custom-houses, post-offices,
mints, arsenals, forts, all possessions of the National
Government, one after another, were seized by
the Rebel slave-masters. As early as the 1st of January,
1861, while James Buchanan was President, the
palmetto flag was hoisted over the custom-house and
post-office at Charleston. Already it had been hoisted
over Castle Pinckney and Fort Moultrie in the harbor
of Charleston, while the national force allowed in these
fortresses surrendered to Rebel slave-masters. This was
followed by the seizure of Fort Pulaski at Savannah,
Fort Morgan at Mobile, Fort Jackson and Fort St.
Philip at New Orleans, Fort Barrancas and Fort McRae
with the navy-yard at Pensacola. Throughout that
whole Rebel region two fortresses only remained to
the National Government: these were Fort Sumter
and Fort Pickens. The steamer Star of the West,
bearing reinforcements to the small garrison cooped in
Fort Sumter, was fired at in the harbor of Charleston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
and compelled to put back discomfited. This was war.
Meanwhile the Rebel States had taken the form of a
confederacy, with Slavery as corner-stone, and proceeded
to organize an immense military force in the service
of the Rebellion. At last, after long-continued preparations,
the Rebel batteries opened upon Fort Sumter,
which, after a defence of thirty-four hours, was compelled
to surrender. There was rejoicing at the Rebel
capital, and the Rebel Secretary of War, addressing an
immense audience, let drop words which reveal the
true character of the war. “No man,” said he, “can
tell where the war this day commenced will end; but
I will prophesy that the flag which now flaunts the
breeze here will float over the dome of the old Capitol
at Washington before the 1st of May. Let them try
<em>Southern chivalry</em> and test the extent of Southern resources,
and it may float eventually over Faneuil Hall
itself.”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> It was already the 12th of April, and the Rebel
flag was to float over the National Capitol before the
1st of May. It was time that something should be
done in self-defence. Not only the National Capitol,
but Faneuil Hall, was menaced, while the boast of
“Southern chivalry” went forth.</p>

<p>Thus far the National Government had done nothing,
absolutely nothing. It had received blow after
blow; it had seen its possessions, one after another,
wrested from its control; it had seen State after State
assume the front of Rebellion; it had seen the whole
combined in a pseudo-confederacy, with a Rebel President
surrounded by a Rebel Cabinet and a Rebel
Congress; and it had bent under a storm of shot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
shell from Rebel batteries. At last it spoke, calling
the country to arms. Search history, and you can find
no instance of equal audacity on the part of rebels, and
no instance of equal forbearance on the part of Government.</p>

<p>The country was called to arms. Nobody can forget
that day, when the people everywhere, inspired by patriotic
ardor, rose in <em>necessary self-defence</em> to save the
National Capitol and Faneuil Hall, already menaced.
For the Rebellion the war had begun long before; but
for the country it began only at that great uprising,
when all seemed filled with one generous purpose, and
nobody hesitated. Men calling themselves Democrats
vied with Republicans. Daniel S. Dickinson and Benjamin
F. Butler made haste to join their country. Party
differences were forgotten as the tocsin sounded.</p>

<p>It was the tocsin summoning the country to defend
itself. The war then and there recognized was, on our
part, a war of national defence, and its simple object
was to put down the Rebellion. You confuse yourself,
if you say that it was to restore the Constitution; and
you misrepresent the fact, if you say that it was to abolish
Slavery. It was for the suppression of the Rebellion,&mdash;nor
more, nor less.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, fellow-citizens, it becomes important to
know and comprehend the Rebellion, and especially its
animating impulse, or soul. From the beginning, its
diagnosis has been essential to the right conduct of the
war; and if at any time the war seems to fail, or foreign
powers seem to lower, it is because our Government
has not recognized the true character of the Rebellion.
“Give me to see,” is the exclamation of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
patriot, that our blows may not fail. To all familiar
with history it was obvious, at once, that this Rebellion
stood out in bad eminence, unlike any other of which
we have authentic record; that it was not a dynastic
struggle, as in the adventurous expeditions of the British
Pretender; that it was not a religious struggle, as in
the French wars of the League; that it was not a struggle
against a conqueror, as in the repeated outbreaks of
Ireland; that it was not a struggle for Freedom, like
that of Switzerland against Austria, of Holland against
Spain, of our fathers against England, of the Spanish-American
States against Spain, and of Greece against
Turkey; that it had in it none of these elements, whether
dynasty, religion, or freedom: for it was simply a
struggle for Slavery, and so completely had Slavery
entered into and possessed it that the Rebellion was
changed to itself. If you would find a parallel to this
transcendent wickedness, you must pass “the flaming
bounds of place and time,” and look on that earliest Rebellion,
when Satan strove against the Almighty Throne
to establish the supremacy of Sin, even as now this insensate
Rebellion strives to establish the supremacy of
Slavery. It is because partisans have failed to see the
true character of the Rebellion, or been unwilling to recognize
it, that they do not feel how absurd it is to say
that the war on our part has been changed, when nothing
has been done but to recognize the identity between
Slavery and the Rebellion. There has been no change.
It is still a war to put down the Rebellion; but we are
in earnest, and are determined that the Rebellion shall
not save itself by skulking under the <i>alias</i> of Slavery.
Call it Rebellion or call it Slavery, it is one and the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>A glance at the immediate origin of this war is enough
for the present occasion. But to dispel all darkness,
and to determine our duty, let me take you, for a few
moments, back to the distant origin of the two elemental
forces now in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Looking at the question abstractly, these two elemental
forces are nothing but Slavery and Liberty. It
is superfluous to add that these are natural enemies, and
cannot exist together. Where Slavery is, there Liberty
cannot be; and where Liberty is, there Slavery cannot
be. To uphold Slavery, there must be uncompromising
denial of Liberty; to uphold Liberty, there must be uncompromising
denial of Slavery. Each, in self-defence,
must stifle the other. Therefore between the two is
constant hostility and undying hate. This eternal warfare
is not peculiar to our country. It belongs to the
nature of universal man. If it fails to show itself anywhere,
it is because Slavery has won its most detestable
triumph, and blotted out the Heaven-born sentiment of
Freedom. Circumstances among us, going back to our
earliest history, have given unprecedented activity to
these two incompatible principles, and have at last
brought them into bloody battle, face to face. But it is
only part of the universal conflict which must endure
so long as a single slave shall wear a chain. Slavery
itself is <em>a state of war</em>, ready to burst forth in blood,
whenever the slave reclaims that liberty which is his
right, or whenever mankind refuses to sanction its inhuman
pretensions.</p>

<p>Go back to the earliest days of Colonial history,
and you will find the conflict already preparing. It
was in 1620 that twenty slaves were landed at Jamestown,
in Virginia,&mdash;the first that ever pressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
soil of our country. In that same year the Pilgrims
landed at Plymouth. Those two cargoes contained the
hostile germs which have ripened in our time. They
fitly symbolize our gigantic strife. On one side is
the slave-ship, and on the other is the Mayflower.
Early events derive importance as we learn to recognize
their undoubted consequences, and these two
ships will be regarded with additional interest when
it is seen that in them were the beginnings of the
present war.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in all the romantic legends of the sea, there
is nothing more striking than the contrast of these two
vessels. Each had ventured upon an untried and perilous
ocean to find an unknown and distant coast. In
this they were alike; but in all else how unlike! One
was freighted with human beings forcibly torn from
their own country, and hurried away in chains to be
sold as slaves: the other was filled with good men,
who had voluntarily turned their backs upon their
own country, to seek other homes, where at least they
might be free. One was heavy with curses and with
sorrow: the other was lifted with anthem and with
prayer. And thus, at the same time, beneath the same
sun, over the same waves, each found its solitary way.
By no effort of imagination do we see on one Slavery
and on the other Liberty, traversing the ocean to continue
here, on this broad continent, their perpetual, immitigable
war.</p>

<p>I am not alone in homage to the Mayflower. Others
have delighted to picture her, and none with more
of that consummate art which makes us see the petty
craft transfigured by the divine cargo than an illustrious
contemporary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hail to thee, poor little ship Mayflower, of Delft-Haven!
poor, common-looking ship, hired by common charter-party
for coined dollars; calked with mere oakum and
tar; provisioned with vulgarest biscuit and bacon: yet
what ship Argo, or miraculous epic ship built by the Sea-Gods,
was other than a foolish bumbarge in comparison?
Golden fleeces, or the like, these sailed for, with or without
effect: thou, little Mayflower, hadst in thee a veritable
Promethean spark, the life-spark of the largest nation on
our earth,&mdash;so we may already name the Transatlantic
Saxon Nation.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is no record of what passed on board the
slave-ship, before the landing of the slaves. The wail
of Slavery, the clank of chains, and the voice of the
master counting his cargo, there must have been. But
the cabin of the Mayflower witnessed another scene, of
which there is authentic record, as the whole company,
by solemn compact, deliberately constituted themselves
a body politic, and set the grand example of a
Christian Commonwealth,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>&mdash;thus indicating the character
which they had claimed for themselves, as “knit
together as a body in a most strict and sacred bond and
covenant of the Lord, of the violation whereof we make
great conscience, and by virtue whereof we do hold ourselves
straitly tied to all care of each other’s good, and
of the whole by every one, and so mutually.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> And so
these two voyages closed; but the two cargoes have endured,
surviving successive generations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>The early social life of the two warring sections attests
the prevailing influence. Virginia continued to be
supplied with slaves, so that Slavery became part of
herself. On the other hand, New England always set
her face against Slavery. To her great honor, in an age
when Slavery was less condemned than now, the Legislature
of Massachusetts censured a ship-master who had
“fraudulently and injuriously taken and brought a negro
from Guinea,” and by solemn vote resolved that
the negro should be “sent back without delay”;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and
not long after enacted the law of Exodus, “If any man
stealeth a man or man-kind, he shall surely be put to
death.”<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Thus at that early day stood Virginia and
New England: for such, at that time, was the designation
of the two provinces which divided British America
by a line of demarcation very nearly coïncident with
the recent slave-line of our Republic.</p>

<p>The contrast appears equally in the opposite character
of their respective settlers. Like seeks like, and the
Pilgrims of the Mayflower were followed by others of
similar virtues, whose first labors on landing were to
build churches and schools. Many of them had the
best education of England; some were men of substance,
and there was no poverty among them that
could cause a blush; while all were most exact and exemplary
in conduct. They were a branch from that
grand Puritan stock, to which, according to the reluctant
confession of Hume, “the English owe the whole
freedom of their Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> We are told by Burke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
that there is a sacred veil to be drawn over the beginnings
of all governments, and that, where this is not
happily supplied by time, it must be found in a discreet
silence. But no veil is needed for the Puritan
settlers of New England. It is very different with the
early settlers of Virginia, recruited from the castaways
and shirks of Old England, and mostly needy men, of
desperate fortunes and dissolute lives, who cared nothing
for churches or schools. Such naturally became
slave-lords. I should not lift the veil which charity
would kindly draw, if a just knowledge of their character
had not become important in illustrating the origin
of our troubles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a common boast of these slave-lords that they
constitute a modern “chivalry,” derived from the “Cavaliers”
of England, and reinforced by the “ennobling”
influences of African Slavery.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> This boast has been so
often repeated, that it has obtained a certain acceptance
among those not familiar with our early history, and
even well-informed persons allow themselves to say
that the conflict in which we are now engaged is a continuance
of the old war between Cavalier and Roundhead.
So far as it is intended to say that the war is
part of the ever-recurring conflict between Slavery and
Liberty, there is no objection to this illustration. But
if it be intended that the Rebels are cavaliers, or descendants
of cavaliers, there is just ground of objection.
I know not if the armies of the Union, now fighting the
world’s greatest battle for Human Rights, may not be
called “Roundheads”; but I am sure that Rebels now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
fighting for Slavery cannot be called “Cavaliers” in any
sense. They are not so in character, as their barbarism
attests; and they are as little so historically.</p>

<p>The whole pretension is a preposterous absurdity, by
which the country has been too much deceived. It is
not creditable to the general intelligence that such a
folly should play such a part. Unquestionably there
were settlers in Virginia, as there were also in New
England, connected with aristocratic families. But in
each colony they were too few to modify essentially
the prevailing population, which took its character
from the mass rather than from any individual. The
origin of Virginia is so well authenticated as to leave
little doubt with regard to its population, unless you reject
all the concurrent testimony of contemporaries and
all the concurrent admissions of historians. There is
nothing in our early history with regard to which authorities
are so various and so clear. From their very
abundance, it is difficult to choose.</p>

<p>The original “Cavaliers” were English; but it is an
historical fact that the Rebel colonies were not settled
exclusively from England. The blood of Scotch, Irish,
Dutch, Germans, Swiss, French, and Jews commingled
there, all of which is amply attested. Huguenots of
France, cruelly banished by the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, found a home in both the Carolinas. William
Gilmore Simms, the novelist of South Carolina, in a
history of his native State, after mentioning the arrival
of the Huguenots, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> “Emigrants followed, though
slowly, from Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; and
the Santee, the Congaree, the Wateree, and Edisto now
listened to the strange voices of several nations, who
in the Old World had scarcely known each other, except
as foes.”<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> From Hewit’s “Historical Account of
South Carolina,” published in 1779, we have details of
settlement by Dutch, French, Swiss, Scotch, and Germans,
followed by the remark, “But of all other countries
none has furnished the province with so many inhabitants
as Ireland.”<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> A similar story is told of North
Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Here is nothing of the boasted “chivalry”;
and if we search the testimony with regard to the character
and condition of these early settlers, the whole
“cavalier” pretension becomes still more improbable,
if not impossible.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Even before English colonization had begun, and
before Sir Walter Raleigh or Captain John Smith had
landed on our coasts, the “temperate and fertile parts
of America” had been proposed as a substitute for
the prison and gibbet. I quote from a Dedicatory
Epistle of Richard Hakluyt “to the right worshipful
and most virtuous Gentleman, Master Philip Sydney,
Esquire.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yea, if we would behold with the eye of pity how all
our prisons are pestered and filled with able men to serve
their country, which for small robberies are daily hanged up
in great numbers, even twenty at a clap out of one jail
(as was seen at the last assizes at Rochester), we would
hasten and further, every man to his power, the deducting
of some colonies of our superfluous people into those temperate
and fertile parts of America, which, being within six
weeks’ sailing of England, are yet unpossessed by any Christians,
and seem to offer themselves unto us, stretching nearer
unto her Majesty’s dominions than to any other part of
Europe. We read that the bees, when they grow to be too
many in their own hives at home, are wont to be led out
by their captains to swarm abroad, and seek themselves a
new dwelling-place.”<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This recommendation, associated with the names of
Hakluyt and Sydney, was followed,&mdash;with what success
you shall know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I begin with the early patron of Virginia, Lord Delaware,
who, after visiting the colony, described the people
there, in a letter dated at Jamestown, July 7, 1610,
as “men of distempered bodies and infected minds,
whom no examples daily before their eyes, either of
goodness or punishment, can deter from their habitual
impieties or terrify from a shameful death.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Little of
chivalry here!</p>

<p>The colony, which began with bad men, was increased
by worse. In November, 1619, King James wrote to
the Virginia Company, “commanding them forthwith
to send away to Virginia an hundred dissolute persons,
which Sir Edward Zouch, the Knight Marshal, would
deliver to them.”<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Thus by royal command was this
colony made a Botany Bay.</p>

<p>The Company, not content with the “hundred dissolute
persons” supplied by the king’s order, entreated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
more, until Captain John Smith, the hero of Virginia,
was moved to express his disgust. He testified to the
evil, when he wrote in 1622: “Since I came from thence,
the Honorable Company have been humble suitors to
his Majesty <em>to get vagabond and condemned men</em> to go
thither; nay, so much scorned was the name of Virginia,
<em>some did choose to be hanged, ere they would go
thither, and were</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This was bad enough.</p>

<p>But the Virginia Company was insensible to the
shame of such a settlement. Its agents and orators
vindicated the utility of the colony. In a work entitled
“<i>Nova Britannia</i>, offering most Excellent Fruits by
Planting in Virginia,” published in London in 1609, and
dedicated to “one of his Majesty’s Council for Virginia,”
it was openly argued, that, unless “swarms of idle persons
in lewd and naughty practices” were sent abroad,
“we must provide shortly <em>more prisons and corrections</em>
for their bad conditions”; and that it was “most profitable
for our state to rid our multitudes of such as lie at
home, pestering the land with pestilence and penury,
and infecting one another with vice and villany, worse
than the plague itself.”<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Dr. Donne, Dean of St. Paul’s,
poet also, in a sermon “preached to the Honorable
Company of the Virginian Plantation, November 30th,
1622,” thus sets forth the merits of the colony: “The
plantation shall redeem many a wretch from the jaws of
death, from the hands of the executioner.… <em>It shall
sweep your streets and wash your doors from idle persons</em>
and the children of idle persons, and employ them.”<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Such were the puffs by which recruits were gained for
Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>History records the unquestionable result, and here
authorities multiply. Sir Josiah Child, in his “Discourse
of Trade,” published in 1694, says: “<em>Virginia</em>
and Barbadoes were <em>first peopled</em> by a sort of loose,
vagrant people, vicious, and destitute of means to live
at home, … such as, had there been no English foreign
plantation in the world, could probably never have
lived at home to do service to their country, but must
have come to be hanged or starved, or died untimely
of some of those miserable diseases that proceed from
want and vice, or else have sold themselves for soldiers,
to be knocked on the head or starved in the quarrels of
our neighbors.”<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Dr. Douglass, in his “British Settlements
in North America,” printed in 1749, is very positive,
saying, “Virginia and Maryland have been for many
years, and continue to be, a sink for transported
criminals.”<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> “Our plantations in America, <em>New England
excepted</em>, have been generally settled, (1.) by malcontents
with the Administrations from time to time;
(2.) by fraudulent debtors, as a refuge from their creditors;
(3.) and by convicts or criminals, who chose transportation
rather than death.”<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Grahame, the Scotch
historian, who has written so conscientiously of our
country, speaking of the first settlers, says of Virginia:
“A great proportion of the new emigrants consisted of
profligate and licentious youths, sent from England by
their friends, with the hope of changing their destinies,
or for the purpose of screening them from the justice or
contempt of their country, … with others like these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
more likely to corrupt and prey upon an infant commonwealth
than to improve or sustain it.”<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The historian
of Virginia, William Stith, whose work was published
at Williamsburg in the last century, is not less
explicit. “I cannot but remark,” he says, “how early
that custom arose of transporting loose and dissolute
persons to Virginia, as a place of punishment and disgrace,
which, although originally designed for the advancement
and increase of the colony, yet has certainly
proved a great prejudice and hindrance to its growth;
for it hath laid one of the finest countries in British
America under the unjust scandal of being <em>a mere hell
upon earth</em>, another Siberia, and only fit for the reception
of malefactors and the vilest of the people; so that
few people, at least few large bodies of people, have
been induced willingly to transport themselves to such
a place, and our younger sisters, the Northern Colonies,
have accordingly profited thereby.”<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> But this is not all.
Another historian of Virginia, of our own day, whose
work was published at Richmond in 1848, while showing
that pride in his State which would change every
settler into a “cavalier,” is compelled to make the following
most rueful confession:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> “Gentlemen, reduced to
poverty by gaming and extravagance, too proud to beg,
too lazy to dig; broken tradesmen, with some stigma of
fraud yet clinging to their names; footmen, who had
expended in the mother country the last shred of honest
reputation they had ever held; rakes, consumed with
disease and shattered in the service of impurity; libertines,
whose race of sin was yet to run; and unruly
sparks, packed off by their friends to escape worse destinies
at home: these were the men who came to aid in
founding a nation, and to transmit to posterity their
own immaculate impress.”<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> And this same historian
confesses that social life in Virginia, beginning in such
baseness, after more than a century, had developed “an
aristocracy neither of talent nor learning nor moral
worth, but of landed and slave interest.”<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> So much for
the testimony of history, even when written and printed
in Virginia. In harmony with this testimony was
the honest exclamation of a Virginian in 1751: “In
what can Britain show a more sovereign contempt for
us than by emptying their jails into our settlements,
unless they would likewise empty their jakes on our
tables?”<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>I know not the number of desperate persons shipped
to Virginia; but there were enough to leave an indelible
impress on the colony, and to give it a name in
the literature of the time. It was this colony which
suggested to Bacon the most pregnant words of one of
his Essays, which furnished to De Foe several striking
passages in one of his romances, which furnished a
confirmatory article in the Dictionary of Postlethwayt,
and which provoked Massinger to a dialogue in one of
his dramas. Glance for a moment at these illustrations.</p>

<p>It is in the Essay on “Plantations” that Bacon thus
brands the early settlement of Virginia:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> “It is a shameful
and unblessed thing to take <em>the scum of people and
wicked condemned men</em> to be the people with whom you
plant; and not only so, but it <em>spoileth the plantation</em>, for
they will ever live like rogues.” Surely there is nothing
in this out of which to construct a “cavalier.”</p>

<p>In the narrative of Moll Flanders, the author of
“Robinson Crusoe,” who gives to all his sketches such
life-like character that they seem to be sun-pictures, exhibits
this same colony. Here is a glimpse. “The
greatest part of the inhabitants of that colony came
thither in very indifferent circumstances from England.
Generally speaking, they were of two sorts: either, first,
such as were brought over by masters of ships to be sold
as servants; or, second, such as are transported, after
having been found guilty of crimes punishable with
death. When they come here, we make no difference;
the planters buy them, and they work together in the
field till their time is out.… Hence many a Newgate
bird becomes a great man; and we have several
justices of the peace, officers of the trained bands, and
magistrates of the towns they live in, that have been
burnt in the hand.… Some of the best men in the
country are burnt in the hand, and they are not ashamed
to own it. There’s Major &mdash;&mdash;, he was an eminent
pickpocket; there’s Justice Ba&mdash;&mdash;r, was a shoplifter;
and both of them were burnt in the hand; and I could
name you several such as they are.”<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Nothing is said
here of “cavaliers.”</p>

<p>The author of the “Dictionary of Commerce,” quoted
often in courts, confirms the testimony of Moll Flanders,
when he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> “Even your transported felons,
sent to Virginia instead of Tyburn, thousands of them,
if we are not misinformed, have, by turning their hands
to industry and improvement, and, which is best of all,
to honesty, become rich, substantial planters and merchants,
settled large families, and been famous in the
country; nay, we have seen many of them made magistrates,
officers of militia, captains of good ships, and
masters of good estates.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Here, again, is nothing said
of “cavaliers.”</p>

<p>Another writer, who travelled through the colonies in
1742-3, says, in the same vein, that “several of the
best planters, or their ancestors, have in the two colonies
[Virginia and Maryland] been originally of the
convict class, and therefore are much to be praised and
esteemed for forsaking their old courses.”<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>While all this cumulative evidence shows that the
settlers did better in Virginia than in England, it fails
to support the Rebel pretension of to-day.</p>

<p>I have referred to Massinger. Here is a curious bit
from a grave comedy of that poet dramatist.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Luke.</i> It is but to Virginia.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Lady Frugal.</i> How? Virginia?</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus from every quarter the testimony accumulates.
And yet, in face of these impartial and unimpeachable
authorities, we are constantly told that Virginia was
settled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span> “cavaliers.”</p>

<p>The territory now occupied by South Carolina originally
constituted part of Virginia. Out of Virginia it
was carved into a separate colony. Although differing
in some respects, the populations seem to have been
kindred in character. Ramsay, the historian of the
State, in a work published at Charleston in 1809, says
that “the emigrants were a medley of different nations
and principles,” and that among them were persons
“who took refuge from the frowns of Fortune and the
rigor of creditors,” “young men reduced to misery by
folly and excess,” and “restless spirits, fond of roving.”
To these were added Huguenots from France.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> But
Grahame tells us that “not a trace of the existence
of an order of clergymen is to be found in the laws of
Carolina during the first twenty years of its history.”<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
And another historian says that “the inhabitants, far
from living in friendship and harmony among themselves,
have been seditious and ungovernable.”<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Such
a people were naturally insensible to moral distinctions,
so that, according to Hewit, pirates “were treated with
great civility and friendship,” and “by bribery and corruption
they often found favor with the provincial juries,
and by this means escaped the hands of justice.”
All of which is declared by the historian to be “evidences
of the licentious spirit which prevailed in the
colony.”<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Grahame uses still stronger language, when
he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span> “The governor, the proprietary deputies, and
the principal inhabitants degraded themselves to a level
with the vilest of mankind by abetting the crimes of
pirates, and willingly purchasing their nefarious acquisitions.”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Such is the testimony with regard to South
Carolina. To call such a people “cavaliers” is an abuse
of terms.</p>

<p>I hope I do not take too much time in exposing a
vainglorious pretension, which has helped to give the
Rebellion a character of respectability it does not deserve.
I dismiss it to general contempt, as one of the
lies by which Slavery, the greatest lie of all, is recommended
to the weak who can be deceived by names.
But you will not fail to remark how naturally Slavery
flourished among such a congenial people. Convicts
and wretches who had set at nought all rights of property
and all decency were the very people to set up
the revolting pretension “of property in man.” If these
were called “cavaliers,” and if their conduct was called
“chivalry,” it was only under the ancient rule of opposites,
because they were in no respect “cavaliers,” nor
had they even the semblance of “chivalry.”</p>

<p>Not in Slavery or its battles is “chivalry” found,
not in vain pretension, not in any indignity to the
poor and lowly. From one who has studied it in its
deeds, we learn that it is “that general spirit or state
of mind which disposes men to heroic and generous
actions, and keeps them conversant with all that is
beautiful and sublime in the intellectual and moral
world.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> How little of this in our Rebel slave-masters!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I come back to the postulate with which I began,
that the present war is simply a conflict between Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
and Liberty. This is a plain statement, which will
defy contradiction. To my mind it is more satisfactory
than that other statement, often made, that it is a conflict
between Aristocracy and Democracy. This in a
certain sense is true; but from its generality it is less
effective than the more precise and restricted statement.
It does not disclose the whole truth; for it does not exhibit
the unique and exceptional character of the pretension
which we combat. For centuries there has been
a conflict between Aristocracy and Democracy, or, in
other words, the few on one side have been perpetually
striving to rule and oppress the many. But now, for
the first time in the world’s annals, a people professing
civilization has commenced war to uphold the intolerable
pretension of <em>compulsory labor without wages</em>, and
that most disgusting coïncident, the whipping of women
and the selling of children. Call these pretenders aristocrats
or oligarchs, if you will; but be assured that
their aristocracy or oligarchy is the least respectable
ever attempted, and is so entirely modern that it is
antedated by the Durham bull Hubbuck, short-horn
progenitor of the oligarchy of cattle, and by the stallion
Godolphin, Arabian progenitor of the oligarchy of horses,
each of which may be traced to the middle of the last
century. And also know, that, if you would find a
prototype in brutality, you must turn your back upon
civilized history, and repair to those distant islands
which witnessed an oligarchy of cannibals, or go to barbarous
Africa, which has been kept in barbarism by an
oligarchy of men-stealers.</p>

<p>Thus it stands. The conflict is directly between
Slavery and Liberty. But because Slavery aims at the
life of the Republic, the issue involves our national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
existence; and because our national death would be the
despair of Liberty everywhere, it involves this great
cause throughout the world. And so I would not for
one moment lose sight of the special enemy; for our
energies can be properly directed only when we are able
to confront him. “Give me to see!” said the old
Greek; and this must be our exclamation now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Slavery, from the beginning, has been a disturber, as
it is now a red-handed traitor. I do not travel back
before the Revolution, but, starting from that great
event, I show you Slavery always offensive, and forever
thrusting itself in the path of national peace and honor.
The Declaration of Independence, as originally prepared
by Jefferson, contained a vigorous passage denouncing
King George for patronage of the slave-trade. The
slave-masters insisted upon striking it out, and it was
struck out; and here was their first victory. At the
adoption of the National Constitution, they insisted
upon recognition of the slave-trade as a condition of
Union; and here was another victory. In the earliest
Congress under the Constitution they commenced the
menace of disunion, and this menace was continued at
every turn of public affairs, especially at every proposition
or even petition touching Slavery, until it triumphed
signally in that atrocious Fugitive Slave Bill
which made all the Free States a hunting-ground for
slaves. Throughout these contests Slavery was vulgar,
brutal, savage, while its braggart orators and chaplains
heralded its claims. Hogarth, in his famous picture of
Bruin, painted Slavery, when he portrayed an immense
grizzly bear hugging, as if he loved it, an enormous
gnarled bludgeon, with a brand of infamy labelled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
every knot, such as <i>Lie Twelve</i>, <i>Lie Fifteen</i>, and about
his throat a clerical band, torn, crumpled, and awry. In
the States where it flourished speech and press were
both despoiled of freedom, and the whole country seemed
to be fast sinking under its degrading tyranny. Everything
in science, or history, or church, or state, was bent
to its support. There was a new political economy,
teaching the superiority of slave labor,&mdash;a new ethnology,
excluding the slave from the family of man,&mdash;a
new heraldry, admitting the slavemonger to the list of
nobles,&mdash;a new morality, vindicating the rightfulness of
Slavery,&mdash;a new religion, recognizing Slavery as a missionary
enterprise,&mdash;a new theodicy, placing Slavery
under the sanctions of Divine benevolence,&mdash;and a new
Constitution, installing Slavery in the very citadel of
Liberty. By such strange inventions the giant felony
fortified itself. At last it struck the pioneers of
Liberty in Kansas. There was its first battle. The
next was when it took up arms against the National
Government, and rallied all its forces in bloody rebellion.
Thus is this Rebellion, by unquestionable pedigree,
derived from Slavery, and the parent lives in the
offspring.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are in earnest against the Rebellion,
you must be in earnest, also, against Slavery; for the
two are synonymous, or convertible terms. The Rebellion
is nothing but belligerent Slavery. It is Slavery
armed and equipped in deadly grapple with Liberty.</p>

<p>Only when we see the Rebellion <em>as it is</em>, in its true
light, face to face, do we see our whole duty. Then must
the patriot, whatever his personal prejudices or party associations,
insist, at all hazards, that Slavery shall not be
suffered to escape from that righteous judgment which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
is the doom of the Rebellion. No false tenderness, no
casuistry of politics, must intrude to save it anywhere;
for you cannot save Slavery anywhere without just to
that extent saving the Rebellion. Show me anywhere
a sympathiser with Slavery, and I show you a sympathiser
with the Rebellion.</p>

<p>Our duty is clear. In the sacred service of patriotism
nothing can be allowed to stand in the way. Fortress,
camp, citadel, each and all, must be overcome; but
the animating soul of every fortress, camp, or citadel
throughout the Rebellion is Slavery. Surely, when the
country is in danger, there can be no hesitation. And
as the greater contains the less, so this greatest charity
of country embraces for the time all other charities.</p>

<p>In striking at Slavery, there is another advantage not
to be forgotten. Such a blow is in strict obedience to
the laws of Nature; and we are reminded by the great
master of thought, Lord Bacon, that only through such
obedience can victory be won,&mdash;<i>vincit parendo</i>. It is
in conformity, also, with all the attributes of God; so
that His Almighty arm will give strength to the blow.
Thus do we bring our efforts in harmony with the sublime
laws, physical and moral, which govern the universe,
while every good influence, every breath of Heaven,
and every prayer of man, is on our side. We also
bring ourselves in harmony with our own Declaration
of Independence, so that all its early promises become a
living letter, and our country is at last saved from that
practical inconsistency which has been a heavy burden
in her history.</p>

<p>To do all this seems so natural and so entirely according
to the dictates of patriotism, that we may well be
astonished that it should meet opposition. But there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
a wide-spread political party, which, true to its history,
now comes forward to save belligerent Slavery,&mdash;even
at this last moment, when it is about to be trampled out
forever. Not to save the country, but to save belligerent
Slavery, is the object of the misnamed Democracy.
Asserting the war, in which so much has been done, to
be a failure,&mdash;forgetting the vast spaces it has already
reclaimed, the rivers it has opened, the ports it has secured,
and the people it has redeemed,&mdash;handing over
to contempt officers and men, living and dead, who have
waged its innumerable battles,&mdash;this political party
openly offers surrender to the Rebellion. I do not use
too strong language. It is actual surrender and capitulation
that are offered, in one of two forms: (1.) by acknowledging
the Rebel States, so that they shall be
treated as independent; or (2.) by acknowledging Slavery,
so that it shall be restored to its old supremacy
over the National Government, with additional guaranties.
The different schemes of opposition are all contained
in one or the other of these two propositions.</p>

<p>Examining these two propositions, we find them
equally flagitious and impracticable. Both allow the
country to be sacrificed for the sake of Slavery: one
by breaking the Union in pieces, that a new Slave
Power may be created; and the other by continuing
the Union, so that the old Slave Power may enjoy its
sway and masterdom. Both pivot on Slavery. One
acknowledges the Slave Power <em>out of the Union</em>; the
other acknowledges the Slave Power <em>in the Union</em>.</p>

<p>Glance, if you please, at these two different forms of
surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p><em>And, first, of surrender by acknowledging the Rebel
States</em>, so that they shall be independent. How futile
to think that there can be any consent to the establishment
of a Slave Power taken from our Republic!
Such a surrender would begin in shame; but it would
also begin, continue, and end in troubles and sorrows
which no imagination can picture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. I do not dwell on the shame that would cover our
Republic, but I ask, on the threshold, how you would
feel in abandoning to the tender mercies of the Rebellion
all those who, from sentiment or conviction or
condition, now look to the National Government as deliverer.
This topic, it seems to me, has not been sufficiently
impressed upon the country. Would that I
could make it sink deep into your souls! There are the
Unionists, shut up within the confines of the Rebellion,
and unable to help themselves. They can do nothing,
not even cry out, until the military power of the Rebellion
is crushed. Let this be done, let the Rebel grip be
unloosed, and you will hear their voices, as joyously
and reverently they hail the national flag. And there,
also, are the slaves, to whom the Rebellion is an immense,
deep-moated, thick-walled, heavy-bolted Bastile,
where a whole race is blinded, manacled, and outraged.
But these, again, are powerless, so long as Rebel sentinels
keep watch and ward over them. To these two classes
in the Rebel States we have owed, from the beginning, a
solemn duty, which can be performed only by perseverance
to the end. The patriot Unionists, who have kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
their loyalty in solitude and privation, like the early
Christians concealed in catacombs, and also the slaves,
who have been compelled to serve their cruel taskmasters,
must not be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no character in which the National
Government may exult more truly than that of Deliverer.
Rarely in history has such a duty, with its attendant
glory, been so clearly imposed. The piety of early
ages found vent in the Crusades, those wonderful enterprises
of valor and travel, which exercised a transforming
influence over modern civilization. But our war is
not less important. It is a crusade, not to deliver the
tomb, but to deliver the living temples of the Lord, and
it is destined to exercise a transforming influence beyond
any crusade in history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. If you agree to abandon patriots and slaves in
the Rebel States, you will only begin your infinite difficulties.
How determine the boundary-line to cleave
this continent in twain? Where shall the god Terminus
plant his stone? What States shall be left at the
North in the light of Liberty? What States shall be
consigned to the gloom of Slavery? Surely no swiftness
of surrender can make you abandon Maryland, now
redeemed by votes of citizen soldiers,&mdash;nor West Virginia,
received as a Free State,&mdash;nor Missouri, which
has been made the dark and bloody ground. And how
about Kentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana? There also
is the Mississippi, once more free from source to sea.
Surely this mighty river will not be compelled again
to wear chains.</p>

<p>These inquiries simply open the difficulties in this
endeavor. If there were any natural boundary, in itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
a barrier and an altar, or if during long generations
any Chinese wall had been built for three thousand
miles across the continent, then perhaps there
might be a dividing line. But Nature and civilization,
by solemn decree, have fixed it otherwise, marking
this broad land, from Northern lake to Southern gulf,
for one Country, with one Liberty, one Constitution,
and one Destiny.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. If the boundary-line is settled, then will arise the
many-headed question of terms and conditions. On
what terms and conditions can peace be stipulated?
Exulting Rebels, whose new empire is founded on the
corner-stone of Slavery, will naturally exact promises
for the rendition of fugitive slaves. Are you, who have
just emancipated yourselves from this obligation, ready
to renew it, and to commit again an inexpiable crime?
If you do not, how can you expect peace? Then it
will remain to determine the commercial relations between
the two separate governments, with rights of
transit and travel. If you think that Rebels, flushed
with success, and scorning their defeated opponents, will
come to any practical terms, any terms which will not
leave our commerce and all engaged in it victims of
outrage, you place trust in their moderation which circumstances
thus far do not justify. The whole idea is
little better than an excursion to the moon in a car
drawn by geese, as described by the Spanish poet.</p>

<p>Long before the war, and especially in the discussions
which preceded it, these Rebels were fiery and most
unscrupulous. War has not made them less so. The
moral sense which they wanted when it began has not
been enkindled since. With such a people there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
no chance of terms and conditions, except according to
their lawless will. The first surrender on our part will
be the signal to a long line of surrenders, each a catastrophe.
Nothing too unreasonable or grinding. If our
own national debt is not repudiated, theirs at least must
be assumed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. Suppose the shameful sacrifice consummated, the
impossible boundaries adjusted, and the illusive terms
and conditions stipulated, do you imagine that you have
obtained peace? Alas, no! Nothing of the sort. You
may call it peace; but it will be war in disguise, ready
to break forth in perpetual, chronic, bloody battle. Such
an extended inland border, over which Slavery and
Liberty scowl at each other, will be a constant temptation,
not only to enterprises of smuggling, but to hostile
incursions, so that our country will be obliged to sleep
on its arms, ready to spring forward in self-defence.
Every frontier town will be a St. Albans.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Military
preparations, absorbing the resources of the people, will
become permanent instead of temporary, and the arts of
peace will yield to the arts of war. The national character
will be changed, and this hospitable continent, no
longer the prosperous home of the poor and friendless,
thronging from the Old World, will become a repulsive
scene of confusion and strife, while “each new day a
gash is added to her wounds.”</p>

<p>Have we not war enough now? Are you so enamored
of funerals, where the order of Nature is reversed, and
parents follow their children to the grave, that you are
willing to keep a constant carnival of Death? Oh, no!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
You all desire peace. But there is only one way to
secure it. So conduct the present war, that, when once
ended, there shall be no remaining element of discord,
no surviving principle of battle, out of which future
war can spring. Above all, belligerent Slavery must
not rear its crest as an independent power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. There is another consequence not to be omitted.
War would not be confined to the two governments
representing respectively the two hostile principles,
Slavery and Liberty. It would rage with internecine
fury among ourselves. Admit that States may fly out
of the Union, and where will you stop? Other States
must follow, in groups or singly, until our mighty galaxy
is broken into separate stars or dissolved into the
nebular compost of a people without form or name.
Where then is country? Where then those powerful
States, the pride of civilization and the hope of mankind?
Handed over to ungovernable frenzy, without
check or control, until anarchy and chaos are supreme,&mdash;as
with the horses of the murdered Duncan, which,
at the assassination of their master,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,</div>
<div class="verse">Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,</div>
<div class="verse">Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make</div>
<div class="verse">War with mankind. ’Tis said they eat each other.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The picture is terrible; but it hardly exaggerates the
fearful disorder. Already European enemies, looking to
their desires for conclusions, predict a general discord.
Sometimes it is said that there are to be four or five
new nations,&mdash;that the Northwest is to be a nation by
itself, the Middle States another, the Pacific States another,
and our New England States still another, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
Rebel Slavery will be the predominant power on this
continent. But it is useless to speculate on the number
of these fractional governments. If disunion is
allowed to begin, it cannot be stopped. Misrule and
confusion will be everywhere. Our fathers saw this
at the adoption of the National Constitution, when, in
a rude sketch of the time, they pictured the Thirteen
States as so many staves bound by the hoops into a
barrel. Let a single stave be taken out, and the whole
barrel falls to pieces. It is easy to see how this must
occur with States. The triumph of the Rebellion will
be not only the triumph of belligerent Slavery, but
also the triumph of State Rights, to this extent,&mdash;first,
that any State, in the exercise of its own lawless
will, may abandon its place in the Union, and,
secondly, that the constitutional verdict of the majority,
as in the election of Abraham Lincoln, is not
binding. With these two rules of conduct, in conformity
with which the Rebellion was organized, there can
be no limit to disunion. Therefore, when you consent
to the independence of the Rebel States, you
disband the whole company of States, and blot our
country from the map of the world.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>I have said enough of surrender by recognition of
the Slave States, or, in other words, of the Slave Power,
<em>out of the Union</em>. It remains now that I ask attention
to that other form of surrender which proposes
<em>recognition of the Slave Power in the Union</em>. Each is
surrender. The first, as we have already seen, abandons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
part of the Union to the Slave Power; the other subjects
the whole Union to the Slave Power.</p>

<p>It is proposed that the Rebel States shall be tempted
to lay down their arms by recognition of Slavery in the
Union, with new guaranties and assurances of protection.
<em>Slavery cannot exist, where it does not govern.</em>
Therefore must we beg Rebel slave-masters back to
govern us. Such, in plain terms, is the surrender proposed.
For one, I will never consent to any such intolerable
rule.</p>

<p>The whole proposition is not less pernicious than that
other form of surrender; nor is it less shameful. It is
insulting to reason, and offensive to good morals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. I say nothing of the ignominy it would bring upon
the Republic, but call attention at once to its character
as a Compromise. In the dreary annals of Slavery
it is by compromise that slave-masters have succeeded
in warding off the blows of Liberty. It was a compromise
by which that early condemnation of the slave-trade
was excluded from the Declaration of Independence;
it was a compromise which surrounded the slave-trade
with protection in the National Constitution;
it was a compromise which secured the admission of
Missouri as a Slave State; and, without stopping to
complete the list, it is enough to say that it was a compromise
by which the atrocious Fugitive Slave Bill was
fastened upon the country, and the Slave Power was
installed in the National Government. And now, after
the overthrow of the Slave Power at the ballot-box,
followed by years of cruel war, another compromise,
greatest of all, is proposed, by which belligerent Slavery,
dripping with the blood of murdered fellow-citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
shall be welcomed to more than its ancient supremacy.
Where is national virtue, that such a surrender can be
entertained? Where is national honor, that the criminal
pettifoggers are not indignantly rebuked?</p>

<p>The proposition is specious in form as baleful in substance.
It is said that Rebel slave-masters should have
their “rights under the Constitution.” To this plausible
language is added that other phrase, “the Constitution
as it is.” All this means Slavery, and nothing
else. For Slavery men resort to this odious duplicity.
Thank God, the game is understood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. But any compromise recognizing Slavery in the
Rebel States is impossible, even if you are disposed to
accept it. Slavery, by the very act of rebellion, ceased
to exist, legally or constitutionally. It ceased to exist
according to principles of public law, and also according
to just interpretation of the Constitution; and having
once ceased to exist, it cannot be revived.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>When I say that it ceased to exist <em>legally</em>, I found
myself on an unquestionable principle of public law,
that Slavery is a peculiar local institution, without origin
in natural right, and deriving support exclusively
from the local government; but if this be true,&mdash;and
it cannot be denied,&mdash;then Slavery must have fallen
with that local government.</p>

<p>When I say that it ceased to exist <em>constitutionally</em>, I
found myself on the principle that Slavery is of such a
character that it cannot exist within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Constitution, as, for instance, in the
National territories, and that therefore it died constitutionally,
when, through disappearance of the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
government, it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>The consequences of these two principles are most
important. Taken in conjunction with the rule, “Once
free, always free,” they establish the impossibility of
any surrender to belligerent Slavery <em>in the Union</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. If, in the zeal of surrender, you reject solemn
principles of public law and Constitution, then let me
remind you of the Proclamation of Emancipation, where
the President, by virtue of the power vested in him
as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the
United States, ordered that the slaves in the Rebel
States “are and henceforward shall be free,” and the
Executive Government, including the military and naval
authorities, are pledged to “recognize and maintain
the freedom of said persons.” By the terms of this
instrument, it is applicable to all slaves in the Rebel
States,&mdash;not merely to those within the military lines
of the United States, but to all. Even if the President
were not in simple honesty bound to maintain
this Proclamation according to the letter, he has not
the power to undo it. The President may make a
freeman, but he cannot make a slave. Therefore
must he reject all surrender inconsistent with this Act
of Emancipation.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that the Court will set aside the
Proclamation. Do not believe it. The Court will do
no such thing. It will recognize this act precisely as it
recognizes other political and military acts, without presuming
to interpose any unconstitutional <em>veto</em>,&mdash;and it
will recognize this act to the full extent, as was intended,
according to its letter, so that every slave in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
Rebel States will be free. Even if the Court should
hesitate, there can be no hesitation with the President,
or with the people, bound in sacred honor to the freedom
of every slave in the Rebel States. Therefore
against every effort of surrender the Proclamation presents
an insuperable barrier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. If you are willing to descend deep down to the
fathomless infamy of renouncing the Proclamation, then
in the name of peace do I protest against any such
surrender. So long as Slavery exists in the Union,
there can be no peace. The fires which seem to be extinguished
will only be covered by treacherous ashes,
out of which another conflagration will spring to wrap
the country in war. This must never be.</p>

<p>It is because Slavery is not yet understood, that any
are willing to tolerate it. See it as it is, and there can
be no question. Slavery is guilty of every crime. The
slave-master is burglar, for by night he enters forcibly
into the house of another; he is highway robber,
for he stops another on the road, and compels him to
deliver or die; he is pickpocket, for he picks the
pocket of his slave; he is sneak, for there is no pettiness
of petty larceny he does not employ; he is horse-stealer,
for he takes from his slave the horse that is
his; he is adulterer, for he takes from the slave the
wife that is his; he is receiver of stolen goods on the
grandest scale, for the human being stolen from Africa
he foolishly calls his own. When I describe the
slave-master, it is simply as he describes himself in the
code he sanctions. All crime is in Slavery, and so
every criminal is reproduced in the slave-master. And
yet it is proposed to bestow upon this whole class not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
only new license for their crimes, but a new lease of
their power. Such surrender would be only the beginning
of long-continued, unutterable troubles, breaking
forth in bloodshed and sorrow without end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>5. Lastly, this surrender cannot be made without
surrender to the Rebellion. Already I have exhibited
the identity between Slavery and the Rebellion; and
yet it is proposed to recognize Slavery in the Union,
when such recognition will be plain recognition of the
Rebellion.</p>

<p>The whole thing is impossible, and not to be tolerated.
Alas! too much blood has been shed, and too much
treasure lavished, for this war to close with any such
national stultification. The Rebellion must be crushed,
whether in the guise of war or under the <i>alias</i> of Slavery.
It must be trampled out, so that it can never show
itself again, or prolong itself into another generation.
Not to do this completely is not to do it at all. Others
may act as they please, but I wash my hands of this
great responsibility. History will not hold such surrender
blameless.</p>

<div class="verse">“An orphan’s curse would drag to hell</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A spirit from on high”;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the orphans of this war must heap curses heaven-high
upon the man who consents to see its blood and
treasure end in nought.</p>

<p>Such are the grounds for the repudiation of all surrender
to Slavery <em>in the Union</em>. I have also shown
that there can be no surrender to Slavery <em>out of the
Union</em>. In either alternative surrender is impossible;
but even if possible, it would be most perilous and degrading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far I have said nothing of platforms or candidates.
I desired to present the issue of principle, so
that the patriot could choose without embarrassment
from party association. Pardon me now, if for one moment
I bring platforms and candidates to the touch-stone.</p>

<p>There is the Baltimore platform, with Abraham Lincoln
as candidate. No surrender here. In one resolution
it is declared that the war must be prosecuted
“with the utmost possible vigor to <em>the complete suppression
of the Rebellion</em>.” In another it is declared, “that,
as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the
strength of this Rebellion, and as it must be always and
everywhere hostile to the principles of republican government,
<em>justice and the national safety demand its utter
and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
There is salvation in these words, pronouncing the doom
of Slavery in the name of justice and the national
safety. The candidate has solemnly accepted them,
not only when he accepted his nomination, but yet
again, when, in the discharge of official duties, he said
briefly, “to whom it may concern,” that there could be
no terms of peace, except on the condition of “the integrity
of the whole Union and the abandonment of
Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In this letter of the President, unquestionably
the best he ever wrote, it is practically declared, in
conformity with the Baltimore platform, that there can
be no surrender to Slavery in the Union or out of the
Union.</p>

<p>Turn to the Chicago platform and its candidate, and
what a contrast! There is surrender in both forms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
The platform surrenders to Slavery <em>out of the Union</em>,
and, in proposing a “cessation of hostilities,” prepares
the way for recognition of the Rebel States. The candidate,
in a letter accepting the nomination, surrenders
to Slavery <em>in the Union</em>. The platform plainly looks
to disunion. The letter seemingly looks to union; but
whether looking to union or not, it plainly surrenders
to Slavery.</p>

<p>There is still another surrender in the Chicago platform.
While professing formal devotion to the Union,
it declines to insist upon “National unity,” or “a union
on the basis of the Constitution of the United States.”
No such terms are employed; but we are invited to
seek peace “on the basis of the Federal Union of the
States”: so that, according to this platform, it is not
the National Union, that union of the people accepted
by Washington and defended by Webster, which we
are to have, but a “Federal Union of the States,” where
State Sovereignty, as accepted by John C. Calhoun and
defended by Jefferson Davis, will be supreme; and all
this simply for the sake of Slavery.</p>

<p>Look at the Chicago platform or candidate as you
will, and you are constantly brought back to Slavery
as the animating impulse. Look at the Baltimore platform
or candidate, and you are constantly brought back
to Liberty as the animating impulse. And thus again
Slavery and Liberty stand face to face,&mdash;the slave-ship
against the Mayflower.</p>

<p>There is another contrast between the two platforms,
which ought not to be forgotten. That of Chicago,
while saying nothing against the Rebellion, uses ambiguous
language, interpreted differently by different
persons; while that of Baltimore is so plain and unequivocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
that it leaves no room for question. This contrast
is greater still, when we turn to the two candidates.
Perhaps never between two candidates was it
presented to the same extent. The Chicago candidate
has written a subtle letter, which is interpreted according
to the desires of its readers,&mdash;some finding peace,
and others finding war. And this double-faced proceeding
is his bid for the Presidency. I need not remind
you that our candidate has never uttered a word of duplicity,
and that his speeches and letters can be interpreted
only in one way. And these are the two representatives
of Slavery and Liberty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, such is the issue of principle, such
are the platforms and candidates. And now, I ask
frankly, Are you for Slavery, or are you for Liberty?
Or, changing the form of the question, Are you for
the Rebellion, or are you for your country? For this
is the question you must answer by your votes. In
your answer, do not forget, I entreat you, its infinite,
far-reaching, many-sided importance. This is no ordinary
election. It is a battle-field of the war; and victory
at the polls will assure victory everywhere. Grant,
Sherman, Sheridan, Farragut, all are watching for it.
Their trumpets are ready to echo back our election
bells.</p>

<p>In every aspect the contest is vast. It is vast in its
relations to our own country,&mdash;vaster still in its relations
to other countries. Overthrow Slavery here, and
you overthrow it everywhere,&mdash;in Cuba, Brazil, and
wherever a slave clanks his chain. The whole execrable
pretension of “property in men,” wherever it now
shows its audacious front, will be driven back into kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
night. Nor is this all. Overthrow Slavery here,
and our Republic ascends to untold heights of power
and grandeur. Thus far its natural influence has been
diminished by Slavery. Let this shameful obscuration
cease, and our example will be the day-star of the
world. Liberty, everywhere, in all her struggles, will
be animated anew, and the down-trodden in distant
lands will hail the day of deliverance. But let Slavery
prevail, and our Republic will drop from its transcendent
career, while the cause of liberal institutions
in all lands is darkened. There have been great battles
in the past, on which Human Progress has been
staked. There was Marathon, when the Persian hosts
were driven back from Greece; there was Tours, when
the Saracens were arrested midway in victorious career
by Charles Martel; there was Lepanto, when the
Turks were brought to a stand in their conquests;
there was Waterloo. But our contest is grander. We
are fighting for national life, assailed by belligerent
Slavery; yet such is the solidarity of nations, and so
are mankind knit together, that our battle now is for
the liberty of the world. The voice of victory here will
resound through the ages.</p>

<p>Never was grander cause or sublimer conflict. Never
holier sacrifice. Who is not saddened at the thought
of precious lives given to Liberty’s defence? The soil
of the Rebellion is soaked with patriot blood, its turf
is bursting with patriot dead. Surely they have not
died in vain. The flag they upheld will continue to
advance. But this depends upon your votes. Therefore,
for the sake of that flag, and for the sake of the
brave men that bore it, now sleeping where no trumpet
of battle can wake them, stand by the flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell me not of “failure.” There can be but one failure,
and that is the failure to make an end of Slavery;
for on this righteous consummation all else depends.
Let Liberty be with us, and no power can prevail against
us. Let Slavery be acknowledged, and there is no
power which will not mock and insult us. Such is
the teaching of history, in one of its greatest examples.
Napoleon, when compelled to exchange his empire for a
narrow island prison, exclaimed in bitterness of spirit,
“It is not the Coalition which has dethroned me, but
liberal ideas.” Not the European Coalition, marshalling
its forces from the Don to the Orkneys, toppled the
Man of Destiny from his lofty throne; but that Liberty
which he had offended. He saw and confessed the terrible
antagonist, when he cried out, “I cannot reëstablish
myself; I have shocked the people; I have sinned
against <em>liberal ideas</em>, and I perish.” Memorable words
of instruction and warning! Ideas rule the world, and,
unlike batteries and battalions, they cannot be destroyed
or cut in pieces. May we so press this contest as not
to shock mankind or sin against Liberty! May we so
close this contest as to win God’s favor! Nature has
placed the eye in the front, that man shall look <em>forward
and upward</em>; and it is only by contortion that
he is able to look behind. Therefore, in looking forward
and upward, we follow Nature. An ancient adventurer,
escaping from the realms of Death, looked
behind, and he failed. We, too, shall fail, if we look
behind. Forward, not backward, is the word,&mdash;firmly,
courageously, faithfully. There must be no false
sentiment or cowardice, no fear of “irritating” Rebels.

<p class="noindent">no Chicago platform proposed “a cessation of hostilities,
with a view to a convention or other peaceable
means”; nor was there any attempt to save the traitors
from Divine vengeance. Personal injuries we may
forgive; but Government cannot always forgive. There
are cases where pardon is out of place. Society that
has been outraged must be protected. That beautiful
land now degraded by Slavery must be redeemed,
while a generous statesmanship fixes forever its immutable
condition. If the chiefs of the Rebellion are
compelled to abdicate in favor of emigrants from the
North and from Europe, swelling population, creating
new values, and opening new commerce,&mdash;if “poor
whites” are reïnstated in rights,&mdash;if a whole race
is lifted to manhood and womanhood,&mdash;if roads are
extended,&mdash;if schools are planted,&mdash;there will be
nothing inconsistent with that just clemency which I
rejoice to consider a public duty. Liberty is the best
cultivator, the truest teacher, and the most enterprising
merchant. The whole country will confess the new-born
power, and those commercial cities now sympathizing
so perversely with belligerent Slavery will
be among the earliest to enjoy the quickening change.
Beyond all question, the overthrow of this portentous
crime, besides immeasurable contributions to civilization
everywhere, will accomplish two things of direct
material advantage: first, it will raise the fee-simple
of the whole South; and, secondly, it will enlarge the
commerce of the whole North.</p>

<p>In this faith I turn in humble gratitude to God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
as I behold my country at last redeemed and fixed in
history, the Columbus of Nations, once in chains, now
hailed as benefactor and discoverer, who gave a New
Liberty to mankind. Foreign powers watch the scene
with awe; saints and patriots from their home in the
skies look down with delight; and Washington, who set
free his own slaves, exults that the Republic, which
revered him as Father, now follows his example.</p>
